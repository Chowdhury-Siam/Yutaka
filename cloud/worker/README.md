# Yutaka Self-Hosted Sync Worker

This is the optional backend used when a Yutaka user wants multi-device synchronization.
The Worker runs on Cloudflare and stores synchronized finance data in the user's Turso database.

For the easiest setup, follow the beginner-friendly guide in the repository's main [`README.md`](../../README.md).

## Registration model

A fresh Worker accepts exactly one first sync account directly from the Yutaka app. Email addresses are not used for authentication. **That first database account automatically becomes the Worker administrator.** The current administrator is the only account allowed to recover the encrypted deployment profile. After the first account exists, unrestricted app registration closes; additional accounts are created from `/profile`.

The administrator role belongs to the earliest remaining account, not to its username text. Renaming that account therefore keeps it as administrator. `/profile` cannot delete the administrator from the account list, but the owner can self-delete through the authenticated app endpoint or `/delete-account`. If other accounts remain, the oldest remaining account becomes administrator; if none remain, first-user registration reopens.

## GitHub Actions deployment values

Use the six-value checklist in [Section 4.1 of the main README](../../README.md#41-the-six-deployment-values):

```text
CLOUDFLARE_NAME
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID
TURSO_DATABASE_URL
TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN
JWT_SECRET
```

`CLOUDFLARE_NAME` may be a GitHub repository variable or secret. Save the other values as repository secrets. `JWT_SECRET` must contain at least 32 characters. There are no separate `ADMIN_USERNAME` or `ADMIN_PASSWORD` deployment secrets.

## Administration portal

**Existing self-hosted Worker owners must keep the Worker current.** GitHub-based deployments redeploy automatically when the fork receives the updated project. Workers deployed from Yutaka's **Deploy Database** screen can also update automatically after future app updates when **Automatic Worker updates** is enabled. Yutaka keeps the deployment profile in the device secure store and an encrypted recovery copy in `worker_state`. Only the current Worker administrator can retrieve that copy. After reinstalling Yutaka, paste the same Worker URL and sign in with the current administrator to restore the deployment values automatically. Existing Turso data and accounts are preserved.

Visit `https://<worker-name>.<account-subdomain>.workers.dev/profile` and sign in with the **current username and password of the account currently marked Administrator**. The portal uses the same charcoal/light surface palette and mint accent as the Yutaka app.

From the account list you can:

- **Create account** — add another Yutaka sync account.
- **Change username** — rename any account without changing its user ID or synchronized data. Renaming the administrator does not transfer its role.
- **Change password** — replace an account password and revoke that account's existing app sessions/recovery key. Changing the administrator password also invalidates the current portal session.
- **Delete** — permanently remove a non-administrator account and its Worker-side data. Administrator self-deletion is intentionally separate and requires the account's own password through Yutaka or `/delete-account`.

Account lists expose only IDs, usernames, creation/update timestamps, status, and whether the row is the administrator. **Invited** means no currently unrevoked device exists; **Active** means at least one unrevoked device exists.

Security details:

- Administrator authentication is required server-side for every account-management endpoint. An app bearer token cannot authorize portal access.
- Random one-hour sessions use `__Host-yutaka-admin` cookies with `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict`, and `Path=/`. Turso stores only keyed session hashes.
- Write requests require an exact matching `Origin` and `X-Profile-Request: 1`. Portal responses are private/not cached and use a nonce-based CSP, frame protection, and no external assets.
- Login is limited to eight attempts per client IP and fifty globally per fifteen minutes.
- Passwords use salted PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 verifiers. Password hashes are never returned by the account API or embedded in HTML.

If administrator access is lost, use Yutaka's normal account-recovery path for the current administrator account. A Worker redeployment does not create or replace administrator credentials.

## Administration API

Administrator-management routes are under `/profile`. Those POST requests use JSON, the same-origin administrator cookie, and `X-Profile-Request: 1`. Self-service deletion uses the authenticated app route `/v1/auth/account` or the browser route `/delete-account`.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/profile` | Login page or authenticated dashboard |
| POST | `/profile/api/login` | `{ "username": "...", "password": "..." }`; creates cookie |
| POST | `/profile/api/logout` | Revokes session and clears cookie |
| GET | `/profile/api/accounts?page=1` | `{ total, page, pageSize, accounts }` |
| POST | `/profile/api/accounts` | `{ "username": "...", "password": "..." }`; creates account |
| POST | `/profile/api/accounts/:id/username` | `{ "username": "..." }`; renames account |
| POST | `/profile/api/accounts/:id/password` | `{ "password": "..." }`; resets password and revokes credentials |
| DELETE | `/profile/api/accounts/:id` | Permanently deletes a non-administrator account and related cloud data |
| DELETE | `/v1/auth/account` | Authenticated self-deletion with current password and `DELETE` confirmation |
| GET/POST | `/delete-account` | Browser self-service deletion page for users without the app |

Authenticated app deployment-recovery endpoints remain under `/v1/deployment-recovery/profile`; only the current Worker administrator can use them.

## Sync model

Clients write SQLite first and queue entity operations. The Worker stores the current entity state, deduplicates operation IDs, appends ordered changes for other devices, and enforces authenticated user scoping. After a successful write, the Worker signals the signed-in user's `SyncHub` Durable Object. Connected devices receive a lightweight `sync-change` WebSocket event and immediately perform the ordinary versioned incremental pull. The sending device is excluded from its own notification.

The WebSocket channel carries no finance payload; synchronized records still travel through the existing authenticated push/pull API. A periodic client pull remains as an eventual-consistency fallback if the live connection is unavailable.

The Flutter client uses merge-first synchronization. Full local reconciliation can upload the complete device snapshot, while cloud restore merges the remote state into the device instead of deleting local-only data.

Profile photos, animated GIFs, and short profile videos use the authenticated `/v1/profile-media/*` API and dedicated Turso tables. The media transfer is chunked separately from finance records, and completion/framing/removal events notify the same realtime hub so another signed-in device can refresh the avatar immediately.

`MAX_SYNC_BATCH_SIZE` defaults to `100`.

## Cloud `.yutakabackup`

`wrangler.self-hosted.toml` runs one five-minute scheduler that checks automatic Analytics reports plus Telegram and Google Drive `.yutakabackup` schedules. Credentials are configured only from the authenticated Yutaka app.

The Worker builds compatible `.yutakabackup` files from synchronized entities and refuses to upload an empty finance backup. Telegram uses the encrypted bot token and destination. Google Drive uses the same OAuth connection configured under Credential; with a Folder ID it uploads there, otherwise it creates/reuses **Yutaka Backup**.

All enabled external schedules—Telegram report, Google Drive report, Telegram backup, and Google Drive backup—must be at least five minutes apart. For Telegram channels, the bot must be an administrator with permission to post messages.

## Analytics report uploads

Authenticated app clients can send locally generated Analytics **PDF**, **XLSX**, or **TXT** reports through `/v1/analytics-upload/*`. Telegram uploads reuse the encrypted Telegram-backup bot token and destination. The same API stores automatic Telegram and Google Drive report schedules, including the selected file format. Scheduled reports are generated server-side from the latest synchronized finance snapshot, so the Flutter app does not need to be running.

Automatic report schedules support Summary or Transaction history, PDF/XLSX/TXT output, Today/This Week/This Month/This Year/All Time/Custom Range date filters, daily/weekly/monthly cadence, and a local-clock delivery time. The Worker enforces at least five minutes between the enabled Telegram report, Google Drive report, Telegram `.yutakabackup`, and Google Drive `.yutakabackup` times; conflicting changes return HTTP 409.

Google Drive uses the user's own Google OAuth Web application. The Worker stores the OAuth Client Secret and refresh token encrypted with a key derived from `JWT_SECRET` and uses a signed ten-minute OAuth state token. With no custom Folder ID it requests `openid email https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file` and creates/reuses **Yutaka Analytics**. When a Folder ID is configured it requests `openid email https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`, validates that the selected folder is accessible and writable, and sends manual and scheduled report uploads to that folder. The callback route does not require an app bearer token because it validates the signed OAuth state instead.

Report payloads are limited to 10 MB and validated according to their format: PDF signature, XLSX ZIP signature, or UTF-8 TXT data, before any third-party upload. Account deletion removes stored Analytics/Drive credentials and backup schedule rows but never deletes files already uploaded to Google Drive or Telegram.

## Troubleshooting

### Cloudflare error 1042

`TURSO_DATABASE_URL` must be a Turso `libsql://*.turso.io` URL. Do not point it at another Worker.

### Schema is not ready

On GitHub, open **Actions > Deploy Self-Hosted Sync Worker > Run workflow** and run it with the latest project files. The workflow applies the database update automatically. When it succeeds, reopen `/health` in your browser.

### Profile image appears only on one device

Open `/health` and confirm `profileMediaSyncAvailable` is `true`. If the field is missing or false, redeploy the latest Worker from **Actions > Deploy Self-Hosted Sync Worker**. Keep Yutaka open briefly on both devices after deployment; the app retries any pending upload and the receiving device performs an immediate media check when Profile is opened. On a brand-new `workers.dev` deployment, the public route/TLS endpoint can take a few minutes to propagate even after Cloudflare accepts the Worker upload.

### Registration is closed

On a fresh Worker, create the first sync account directly from Yutaka. Once that first account exists, create additional accounts from the `/profile` website using **+ Create account**. For another device using an existing account, select **Login** in Yutaka.


### Password recovery

Current Yutaka builds recover forgotten passwords from the `/profile` administration portal using **Change password**. The administrator does not need the old account password. A successful reset revokes the account's existing refresh sessions.

The legacy `POST /v1/auth/recover` and `POST /v1/auth/recovery-key` endpoints remain available only for backward compatibility with older Yutaka app versions. New app builds do not expose or call that recovery-key flow.

## Optional command-line setup

Use Node.js 22.13 or newer.

```bash
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

Apply the schema:

```bash
export TURSO_DATABASE_URL='libsql://your-db.turso.io'
export TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN='your-token'
npm run schema:apply
```

For deployment, use **Actions > Deploy Self-Hosted Sync Worker > Run workflow** on GitHub. It applies the schema and deploys the Worker runtime secrets. The first Yutaka account created afterward becomes administrator automatically.

`schema.sql` can be applied again without deleting existing sync data. `scripts/apply-schema.mjs` migrates older email-based accounts and adds the recovery-key and session-version columns.

For advanced deployment integrations, `scripts/prepare-secrets.mjs` validates and emits only `TURSO_DATABASE_URL`, `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN`, and `JWT_SECRET` for Wrangler. The GitHub workflow writes this payload to a restricted temporary file and removes it afterward.
