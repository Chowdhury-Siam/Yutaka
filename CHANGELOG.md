## Flatpak runtime keyfile maintenance (1.0.1282+326)

- Accept spaces and tabs around `version`/`versions` assignments and graphics branch values; GNOME 51 runtime metadata uses `versions = ...`.
- Add actual Flathub GNOME 51 metadata for x86_64 and aarch64 as regression fixtures, with source commit references. Verify that these cases fail with the previous parser and pass with the fix.
- Preserve lean extension selection and keep app and Worker versions unchanged for this packaging-only correction.

## Flatpak metadata and Windows GUI check maintenance (1.0.1282+326)

- Read the complete GL extension metadata, prefer `versions` over the NVIDIA-only `version=1.4`, and select the standard Mesa branch regardless of metadata key/list order.
- Cover both architecture metadata formats, NVIDIA selection and single-version fallback; include declared versions in graphics-detection failures.
- Wait for the Windows installer's Done control after the completion label appears, including remembered-shortcut upgrades, instead of racing the remaining caption updates.
- Keep app and Worker versions unchanged for these packaging/CI fixes.

## Release contract test maintenance (1.0.1282+326)

- Update the Telegram backup contract to check the shared conflict reconciler used by the sync reliability fix.
- Update the sign-out contract to include clearing refresh-token rotation replay state while revoking only the current user's token.
- Keep app and Worker versions unchanged for this test-only fix.

## 1.0.1282+326

- Remove the redundant non-null assertion in sync conflict reconciliation after Dart flow analysis already promotes the remote change.
- Preserve the existing sync reliability, loan additions, APK signing and lean Flatpak packaging fixes.
- Bump synchronized app/Android/Worker release metadata to `1.0.1282+326`.

## Lean Flatpak installation maintenance (1.0.1281+325)

- Ship a lean Flatpak installation script with both architecture releases, skipping related media/language packs while keeping runtime dependency verification and standard/active NVIDIA graphics support.
- Read the graphics ABI from installed runtime metadata and reuse existing user/system installation scope and shared runtimes without changing finance data or globally masking extensions.
- Verify the lean installation in clean Flatpak directories before dependency/startup/database checks; add installation selection and failure regression coverage.
- Keep app and Worker versions unchanged for packaging/CI-only changes; ordinary Flatpak installs and updates retain the runtime's normal extension behavior.

## 1.0.1281+325

- Preserve rejected operations until a complete cloud pull and reconciliation succeed, including explicit deletes for every entity type.
- Coalesce pending mutations by entity, serialize legacy same-entity queues, and advance newer edits when an in-flight operation is acknowledged.
- Reconcile against the actual pulled server version, preserve edits made during a sync, and queue preserved local rows atomically with their merge.
- Validate push receipts and advancing pull pages before acknowledging operations or saving a cursor; keep pending status visible until the queue settles.
- Rotate refresh tokens atomically with a bounded, deterministic replay of a lost response; serialize client refreshes and limit expired-token retry recursion.
- Retry transient database write-lock acquisition, reject malformed sync input before writing, and add server/database/network regression coverage.
- Preserve loan additions and permanent APK signing; bump synchronized release metadata to `1.0.1281+325`.

## 1.0.1280+324

- Add an Add money action to lent and borrowed loan details, with amount, date/time, optional note and optional account recording.

- Include additions in principal, remaining balance and dated interest calculations; exclude additions from paid/progress/repayment totals.
- Preserve additions through cloud sync and backup merges, support linked transaction edits/deletes, and reopen settled loans when additional money remains due.
- Add loan calculation, persistence, account movement, legacy migration and cloud recovery regression coverage.
- Preserve the APK signing workflow fix and bump synchronized app/release metadata to `1.0.1280+324`.

## Android APK certificate CI maintenance (1.0.1279+323)

- Explicitly sign final direct APKs with v1, v2 and v3 using the permanent release key before artifact upload.
- Require signature verification, including the embedded JAR certificate, and match the final APK certificate to the configured keystore; never skip verification when signing tools are missing.
- Add regression coverage for signing/verification failures, certificate mismatch and missing artifacts/tools.
- Keep app and Worker versions unchanged for this release-workflow-only fix.

## Standalone Flatpak CI packaging (1.0.1279+323)

- Package the existing Linux release bundle as standalone x64 and ARM64 Flatpaks using native GitHub runners and the GNOME runtime.
- Preserve the complete Flutter bundle and required libjsoncpp library, export the launcher/icon/metadata, and keep host file access restricted to portals.
- Verify installed runtime dependencies, sandbox startup and private database initialization before uploading; include verified packages in stable release publication.
- Document GitHub installation/manual updates and distinguish this AI-assisted binary packaging from an independently human-authored Flathub source-build submission.
- Keep app and Worker versions unchanged for packaging/CI-only changes.

## Flatpak storage test maintenance (1.0.1279+323)

- Preserve and restore the nullable SQLite factory so Linux tests do not read the throwing factory getter before FFI initialization.
- Replace the method-channel-only path mock with a PathProviderPlatform fake, following the plugin testing guidance.
- Use the in-process SQLite FFI test factory and restore test globals after initialization failures.
- Declare the already-resolved platform interface as a development dependency and enable expanded Linux test reporting.
- Keep app and Worker versions unchanged for this test/CI-only fix.

## 1.0.1279+323

- Prepare a Flatpak edition: detect its distribution flag or sandbox, hide Settings Updates, skip startup app-update checks, and refuse GitHub app checks and Linux installer downloads/launches.
- Keep the Flatpak database, internal backups and analytics save fallback in private application-support storage.
- Add Flatpak desktop metadata, draft AppStream metadata and a human-maintainer preparation guide; no Flathub manifest or submission is generated.
- Run direct and Flatpak-mode updater, Settings and database/backup persistence tests in Linux CI.
- Bump synchronized release metadata to `1.0.1279+323`.

## 1.0.1278+322

- Correct loan direction arrows: “I gave” / money lent points outward, and “I took” / money borrowed points inward, in the shared loan form and loan timeline.
- Bump synchronized release metadata to `1.0.1278+322`.

## 1.0.1277+321

- Replace macOS DMG publishing with a universal PKG containing the custom Yutaka Setup app, retaining the portable application ZIP.
- Use macOS Installer only to prepare the setup launcher; open the themed custom installer as the signed-in user for folder selection, installation, progress, retry and Launch Yutaka.
- Prefer PKG in the in-app updater, include PKG in update cleanup, and retain fallback for older DMG/ZIP releases.
- Add optional Developer ID Installer certificate configuration and sign/notarize/staple the final PKG separately from the app and custom setup.
- Verify the setup extracted from the actual PKG, test packaging and safe user-session handoff, and remove obsolete DMG layout tooling/artwork.
- Bump synchronized release metadata to `1.0.1277+321`.

## 1.0.1276+320

- Hide the Updates entry in Settings for Google Play builds, using the existing build-distribution flag.

- Bump synchronized release metadata to `1.0.1275+319`.

## Android Gradle download CI maintenance (1.0.1274+318)

- Start the generated Gradle wrapper before dependency checks and compilation, retrying temporary download/startup failures up to four attempts with bounded timeouts and backoff.
- Exercise immediate success, transient failure recovery, and retry exhaustion using the workflow's actual shell block.
- Keep app and Worker versions unchanged for this workflow-only fix.

## Release metadata test maintenance (1.0.1274+318)

- Correct the desktop release contract's Android build-code expectation from 317 to 318, matching the delivered release metadata.
- Keep app and Worker versions unchanged for this test-only correction.

## 1.0.1274+318

- Organize shared transaction cards into a title/amount row, category row, date/time row, and optional notes row.
- Let date and time wrap independently, keep notes from disrupting the date, and omit categories that repeat the title.
- Align icons and amounts at the top and use lighter detail text for easier scanning in transaction, category, and budget lists.
- Bump synchronized release metadata to `1.0.1274+318`.

## 1.0.1273+317

- Replace the loan editor's due-date switch and separate date/time pickers with one compact Due date button, showing Off or the selected date and time.
- Move the enable switch and both pickers into a dedicated popup. Apply only when Done is pressed, preserve the current choice when dismissed, and allow turning the due date off.
- Retain existing due dates when editing and reject deadlines earlier than the loan start date/time.
- Bump synchronized release metadata to `1.0.1273+317`.

## Windows installer CI maintenance (1.0.1272+316)

- Keep status/button lookup and failure diagnostics independent of synchronous install-path reads, preventing `Install location did not respond` from aborting the installation completion wait.
- Retain bounded explicit path validation and the overall installation timeout; add regression tests that reproduce a busy path control and run them in Windows CI before the real fixture installation.
- Replace bare button messages with an activated window and cursor-aligned mouse move/press/release; post button release so modal/synchronous handlers remain asynchronous.
- Toggle the checkbox through Windows system input and verify its actual VCL checked value before installing. In the isolated fixture, also verify native task agreement and the saved upgrade choice; guard all test controls and handlers behind `InstallerTestAppId`.
- Wait for the actual foreground Browse picker to disappear before continuing, and retain wizard and process-dialog diagnostics in `ui-failure.log` on a failed check.
- Keep app and Worker release versions unchanged for this test-only fix.

## 1.0.1272+316

- Apply the Windows installer's shortcut choice after Inno creates its task list so the visible checkbox controls actual shortcut creation.
- Retain the saved shortcut choice on upgrades and honor explicit task command-line options; keep silent installation on Inno's native task handling.
- Exercise the styled checkbox through cursor movement and mouse press/release events, then verify actual shortcut creation and deselection. Check the saved choice on a later upgrade and include native styles in failure diagnostics.
- Bump synchronized release metadata to `1.0.1272+316`.

## 1.0.1271+315

- Fix Windows installer Close and Cancel actions by keeping Inno’s internal Cancel control available to its cancellation engine outside the custom layout.
- Extend the isolated Windows GUI gate to exercise both custom cancellation buttons and native window closing before installation.
- Prepare bundled Linux SQLite assets with SHA-256 verification, bounded download retries and an architecture/lockfile cache; preserve normal native-asset bundling.
- Capture verbose Linux build and SQLite hook failure logs. The previous abbreviated log did not reveal the hook’s underlying exception.
- Bump synchronized release metadata to `1.0.1271+315`.

## 1.0.1270+314

- Align the Time • Date and Service charge icons beside their titles, with the selected values centered on a separate line underneath. Keep the shared header flexible for larger text and narrow screens.
- Apply the same alignment to the loan editor’s Time • Date control.

## 1.0.1269+313

- Fix disabled Windows installer controls: keep Inno’s native Next button available during startup page skipping while displaying only the custom Yutaka controls.
- Put the inline install location on the native directory page, preserving Inno’s path validation and committing the selected folder before installation.
- Keep native close-app and restart decisions available during preparation.
- Add a Windows GUI regression gate that builds an isolated fixture with the real installer script and exercises enabled controls, Close/cancel, Browse, invalid/custom paths, shortcuts, installation, upgrade, data preservation and Launch before publishing installers.

## 1.0.1268+312

- Request automatic reopening after Android confirms a successful direct/GitHub APK update. Keep the success message for the updated app’s top popup.
- Provide a quiet Open Yutaka completion notification when Android blocks the background launch, and remove it when the app opens. No extra permissions are requested.
- Handle recent self-updates through both session results and the package-replacement broadcast, matching the expected app version and session and deduplicating completion so it opens only once. Failed or cancelled installs do not trigger reopening; unrelated external app updates do not use the replacement path.

## 1.0.1267+311

- Show the chosen date, time and optional ranges directly in the transaction editor’s Time • Date button after closing its configuration popup. Existing transactions show their saved selection immediately.
- Show the selected fixed service charge or percentage on the main form. Percentage charges include the calculated currency amount when a base amount is entered and refresh as that amount changes; disabled charges show Off.
- Show the selected start date and time on the loan editor’s matching control, using the same compact, wrapping summary style.

## 1.0.1266+310

- Replace desktop setup screens with a complete custom Yutaka layout: dark header, real app icon, branded finance sidebar, welcome screen, install folder, progress, failure/retry and Launch Yutaka completion.
- Keep Windows installation and uninstall behavior on the native Inno engine, including visible prerequisite and close-app decisions.
- Add a small universal macOS AppKit setup app inside the DMG. Verify the embedded payload and app signature before staged installation, preserve financial data, and restore the previous app when the final move fails.
- Open the custom Linux and macOS installers from in-app updates, while retaining older release package fallbacks and the shared top update popup.
- Exercise the Linux setup buttons and failure/retry flow under Xvfb, and run signed macOS backend tests plus a mounted-DMG UI check on the macOS runner.

## [1.0.1265] - 2026-10-03

- Show app download percentages in the same full top popup used for automatic Worker updates.
- Transition to an animated “Installing Yutaka” popup while preparing and opening the platform installer; dismissing progress leaves installation running.
- Report Android installation success, cancellation and failure through the top popup, including results recovered after the app restarts.
- Show “Worker deployed successfully” after deployment health verification, or a red error popup when automatic deployment fails.
- Keep progress below system status bars, wrap long text, respect reduced motion, and let outcome messages temporarily take priority over ongoing updates.
- Bump synchronized release metadata to `1.0.1265+309`.

## [1.0.1264] - 2026-10-03

- Test maintenance: dispose the Worker banner test's semantics handle in `finally` before Flutter's end-of-test verification, including when assertions fail. Keep release version unchanged.
- Windows CI maintenance: validate the actual Inno Setup engine and Yutaka theme by compiling a small probe, install to an explicit directory when needed, and use that verified compiler for packaging. Retain installation logs on failure and keep release version unchanged.
- Test/CI maintenance: assert the Worker banner's accessible label, live announcement, visibility and lack of actions without assuming unrelated framework semantics flags; print expanded Flutter failure details. Keep release version unchanged.
- Isolate the Worker update live region so assistive technology receives its status independently of surrounding content.
- Wait for the platform/theme transition before asserting desktop banner geometry in widget tests.
- Hash Linux installer payloads in bounded chunks, supporting the Python 3.10 CI runner while preserving corruption checks.
- Install the signed official Inno Setup 6.7.3 release when the Windows runner has an older compiler; retain the branded installer theme.
- Bump synchronized release metadata to `1.0.1264+308`.

## [1.0.1263] - 2026-10-03

- Show automatic Worker updates in a centered, safe-area top banner matching Yutaka's existing popup layout, green icon badge, rounded card and typography.
- Animate a small progress spinner while installation runs; retain static feedback when reduced motion is enabled and hide the banner when updating finishes.
- Give other feedback popups priority in the shared top slot, then resume Worker progress if the update is still running.
- Add widget checks for placement, text wrapping, touch passthrough, popup priority, reduced motion and update completion; retain the app-download percentage indicator.
- Bump synchronized release metadata to `1.0.1263+307`.

## [1.0.1262] - 2026-10-03

- Add desktop installation interfaces following Yutaka's charcoal surfaces, green accent and real app icon.
- Windows uses a dark branded setup wizard while retaining its existing installer ID, per-user upgrades and optional code signing.
- Linux x64/ARM64 releases include a graphical `.run` installer with location/shortcut choices, animated progress, a Launch button and terminal setup support. Preserve app data and verify the embedded payload before installation.
- macOS uses a branded drag-to-Applications DMG with a fixed Finder layout and the app's volume icon; preserve universal binaries, signing/notarization and the portable ZIP.
- Keep fast compression and concurrent packaging; add installer regression tests and Linux UI verification to CI.
- Bump synchronized release metadata to `1.0.1262+306`.

## [1.0.1261] - 2026-10-03

- CI maintenance: retry GitHub Pages deployment after transient OIDC/token-service failures, preserve the successful page URL, and fail after three unsuccessful attempts. Keep release version unchanged.
- Add a small animated update indicator across app screens during automatic Worker deployment and app update downloads.
- Show real download percentage when the package size is known; hide the indicator on completion, cancellation or failure.
- Keep routine Worker version checks quiet and respect reduced-motion settings.
- Retain popup fixes and build optimizations; bump release metadata to `1.0.1261+305`.

## [1.0.1260] - 2026-10-03

- Fix the feedback overlay contract test to require full title/message wrapping instead of the obsolete 94-pixel height cap. Test-only maintenance keeps the existing release version unchanged.
- CI maintenance: improve Android Gradle/SDK caches and Windows/macOS native compilation reuse; use faster Windows installer compression. Keep release version `1.0.1260+304` unchanged for this workflow-only update.
- Let top feedback popups grow to show the complete message and title, including with larger text.
- Recognize negative messages such as “cannot be decrypted” before success words such as “saved.”
- Allow longer reading time for longer popup messages while retaining the dismiss button.
- Bump release metadata to `1.0.1260+304`.

## [1.0.1259] - 2026-10-03

- Fix the loan write-off contract test to accept menu presentation properties while still requiring the active-loan guard.
- Retain the loan popup and failed-run cleanup improvements.
- Bump release metadata to `1.0.1259+303`.

## [1.0.1258] - 2026-10-03

- Round the loan action menu and reduce row and divider spacing.
- Style Delete with the theme error color and a trash icon.
- Bump release metadata to `1.0.1258+302`.

## [1.0.1257] - 2026-10-03

- Remove the Default date filter card from Settings and its unused label helper.
- Bump release metadata to `1.0.1257+301`.

## [1.0.1256] - 2026-10-03

- Move the transaction count, selected period and sort summary below the toolbar into the full-width list header.
- Allow the summary to wrap naturally on narrow screens and with larger text instead of truncating beside the action buttons.
- Retain automatic Android self-updates and bump release metadata to `1.0.1256+300`.

## [1.0.1255] - 2026-10-03

- Direct Android updates use PackageInstaller self-update sessions on Android 12+, requesting installation without another tap when Android permits it.
- Automatically show Android confirmation when required; older Android versions retain the standard installer.
- Stage APKs off the UI thread and preserve the downloaded APK for retries after cancellation or failure.
- Resume automatically after install permission is granted without reopening cancelled installation prompts.
- Bumped release metadata to `1.0.1255+299`.

## [1.0.1254] - 2026-10-03

- Added the required block around the multiline credential-load account guard to resolve `curly_braces_in_flow_control_structures`.
- Retained the credential restoration, keyboard visibility, and logo fixes.
- Bumped synchronized release metadata to `1.0.1254+298`.

## [1.0.1253] - 2026-10-03

- Restores saved Telegram/Google Drive credential metadata independently so a failed provider request cannot discard the other provider settings after a fresh login.
- Distinguishes unavailable settings from genuinely unconfigured credentials, blocks unsafe saves until loaded, and shows a clear saved Telegram token placeholder.
- Reloads Credential when the account/Worker changes and ignores stale requests.
- Preserves successfully loaded credentials in backup/report screens and rejects incomplete Worker responses instead of silently treating them as empty settings.
- Retained previous keyboard and logo fixes; synchronized release metadata to `1.0.1253+297`.

## [1.0.1252] - 2026-10-03

- Added shared focus-aware popup positioning to keep inputs and nearby actions above the keyboard without shrinking the form or enabling page scrolling.
- Covers Add/Edit transaction, Add/Edit subscription, loan creation/editing, and loan payments.
- Removed the competing loan-note scroll wrappers and added keyboard visibility, focus-switching, and keyboard-dismissal widget regression checks.
- Retained the previous launcher and splash-logo fixes.
- Bumped synchronized release metadata to `1.0.1252+296`.

## [1.0.1251] - 2026-10-03

- Replaced the old Android splash badge with the centered Y mark and transparent padding so the Android 12+ circular mask cannot clip the logo.
- Added a pixel-level splash safe-circle regression test and included splash rendering in the existing icon generator.
- Retained previous launcher-logo, transaction-layout, and test-contract fixes.
- Bumped synchronized release metadata to `1.0.1251+295`.

## [1.0.1250] - 2026-10-03

- Updated the obsolete transaction-note keyboard contract to verify the requested fixed, non-scrollable popup and keyboard sizing behavior.
- Kept loan-note keyboard contracts and the launcher-logo fix unchanged.
- Bumped synchronized release metadata to `1.0.1250+294`.

## [1.0.1249] - 2026-10-03

- Fixed the Android launcher logo by removing the clipped square badge from the adaptive foreground and centering the Y mark.
- Regenerated all launcher densities and legacy square/round icons from the existing vector artwork.
- Retained the fixed Add/Edit transaction popup from 1.0.1248.
- Bumped synchronized release metadata to `1.0.1249+293`.

- Removed page scrolling and automatic notes scrolling from the Add/Edit transaction popup.
- Kept the existing fixed adaptive popup layout and keyboard dismissal behavior.
- Bumped synchronized release metadata to `1.0.1248+292`.

## [1.0.1247] - 2026-10-03

- Fixed three `flutter analyze --no-pub` warnings in the filtered-empty Transaction state by making the secondary action and label non-null after exhaustive branch assignment.
- Removed the redundant null check, dead null-aware fallback, and resulting dead code without changing the empty-state behavior.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker metadata to `1.0.1247+291`.

## [1.0.1246] - 2026-10-02

- Fixed the Transaction Notes field so focusing it reliably scrolls the field and save controls above the on-screen keyboard after the IME animation settles.
- Made Loan note fields keyboard-aware in both the loan editor and payment editor: normal popup sizing is preserved until the note is focused, then the content becomes temporarily scrollable so the note stays visible above the keyboard.
- Added regression coverage for transaction and loan note keyboard visibility behavior.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker metadata to `1.0.1246+290`.

## [1.0.1245] - 2026-10-02

- Updated in-app branding, Android launcher/adaptive/round icons, Android splash and notification mark, Windows ICO, Linux/macOS icon source, and README branding artwork.
- Added `assets/icons/yutaka_logo.svg` as the canonical logo source and regenerated raster assets from it.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker metadata to `1.0.1245+289`.

## [1.0.1244] - 2026-10-02

- Removed the redundant **Change date range** calendar action from the Analysis page header.
- Kept the Analysis filter action and existing range-dependent analysis behavior unchanged.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker metadata to `1.0.1244+288`.

## [1.0.1243] - 2026-10-02

- Fixed the Transaction page empty state so an empty date/filter result is no longer presented like deleted or missing transaction data.
- Added visible `shown / total` transaction counts while filters are active, a removable active date-range chip, and active styling for date/filter controls.
- Added one-click `Show all transactions`, `Change date range`, and `Clear filters` recovery actions that only reset view preferences and never modify transaction rows.
- Added a direct Transaction date-range action and regression coverage for filtered-empty transaction states and data-safe filter resets.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker metadata to `1.0.1243+287`.

## [1.0.1242] - 2026-10-02

- Moved the Analysis date-range control from the Cash flow trend card into the top app-bar actions, immediately before the Analysis filter.
- Kept the existing date-range picker behavior unchanged while reducing controls inside the chart card.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker metadata to `1.0.1242+286`.

## [1.0.1241] - 2026-10-02

- Fixed release version parsing for Windows CRLF line endings across Android, Linux, macOS, and release publication.
- Fixed browser account-deletion forms rejecting their own requests: the deletion page uses a same-origin referrer policy so native POSTs retain their Origin header. Cross-origin and opaque-origin submissions remain blocked.
- Attached the signed Google Play `.aab` to GitHub Releases alongside the direct APK downloads.
- Fixed the `libflutter.so` 16 KB validator false positive: RELRO that exactly covers an entire LOAD segment is accepted, matching Android's linker. Misaligned RELRO with a writable tail and LOAD alignment below 16 KB still fail. Added runnable Python regressions to the Android quality gate.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker metadata to `1.0.1241+285`.

## [1.0.1240] - 2026-10-02

- Fixed the remaining Google Play 16 KB RELRO failure from `libdatastore_shared_counter.so` by moving the complete AndroidX DataStore runtime family to `1.3.0-alpha11`, whose native shared-counter build uses the corrected linker path.
- Added strict app-module DataStore constraints so transitive Flutter plugins cannot select the incompatible 1.1.x/1.2.x native artifact.
- Added an Android release dependency-resolution gate that proves `playReleaseRuntimeClasspath` resolves `datastore-core-android:1.3.0-alpha11` before the Play AAB is built. The final ELF/RELRO validator remains mandatory.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker metadata to `1.0.1240+284`.

## [1.0.1239] - 2026-10-02

- Removed the slow Android emulator-based real upgrade/data-loss GitHub Actions gate. The normal analyzer/test gate and Worker data-integrity gate remain release blockers.
- Fixed Google Play 16 KB native page-size validation by forcing the AndroidX DataStore dependency family to `1.1.7`, avoiding the `1.2.0` `libdatastore_shared_counter.so` GNU_RELRO alignment regression while keeping the final AAB validator enabled.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker metadata to `1.0.1239+283`.

## [1.0.1238] - 2026-10-02

### Fixed

- Split the combined release workflow into independent Android, Windows, Linux, and macOS GitHub Actions so a platform failure is isolated to its own run.
- Added a separate stable-release publisher that waits for successful artifacts from all four platform workflows for the same commit before publishing them together.
- Workflow-only maintenance keeps the existing app/Android/Worker version unchanged.
- Made the real Android upgrade/data-loss gate deterministic when a fresh previous APK has not created SQLite yet: CI now bootstraps the baseline schema from the checked-out previous release source instead of waiting on first-run/onboarding timing.
- The source-derived fixture replays the previous release's static `CREATE TABLE` definitions and idempotent `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` migrations, preserves its `PRAGMA user_version`, seeds sentinel finance data, then requires the previous APK itself to open and preserve that database before the in-place update.
- The probe now creates the app-private `databases/` directory explicitly and captures private-storage diagnostics on failure.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker metadata to `1.0.1238+282`.

## [1.0.1237] - 2026-10-02

- Hardened the real Android upgrade/data-loss gate so it selects the latest prior stable release with the same Android application ID.
- The emulator test now reads the application ID from both built APK manifests, rejects incompatible package IDs before install, and uses the detected ID for every PackageManager, launcher, run-as, database, and upgrade operation.
- Added a PackageManager registration wait after both the initial install and in-place replacement, preventing launcher resolution races after a successful APK install.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker metadata to `1.0.1237+281`.

## [1.0.1236] - 2026-10-02

### Fixed

- Fixed the Android upgrade/data-loss emulator launcher resolver so the package is supplied as the MAIN/LAUNCHER Intent package (`-p`) instead of being misread as positional Intent data.
- Removed the fabricated `.MainActivity` fallback; the gate now resolves the actual installed launcher component, with a `query-activities` fallback and package diagnostics if Android cannot resolve one.
- Kept strict `am start -W -S` / `Status: ok` startup verification and the real in-place data-preservation checks mandatory.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker metadata to `1.0.1236+280`.

## [1.0.1235] - 2026-10-02

### Fixed

- Replaced the Android upgrade/data-loss emulator probe's fragile `adb shell monkey` launcher with deterministic MAIN/LAUNCHER activity resolution plus `am start -W -S`.
- The probe now requires Android to report `Status: ok` for each launch and emits the resolved component/output on failure, while keeping the real in-place upgrade and finance-data preservation checks mandatory.
- Added release-contract coverage preventing the data-loss gate from reverting to `monkey`.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker metadata to `1.0.1235+279`.

## [1.0.1234] - 2026-10-02

- Hardened Linux AppImage packaging against transient GitHub `linuxdeploy` release-asset HTTP 5xx failures.
- Added a cached `linuxdeploy` acquisition path with GitHub CLI/API first and a bounded direct-URL retry fallback.
- Added ELF, CPU-architecture, and executable validation before any downloaded/cached `linuxdeploy` AppImage can run.
- Added release-contract coverage for the resilient Linux packaging tool fetch.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker metadata to `1.0.1234+278`.

## [1.0.1233] - 2026-10-02

### Fixed

- Hardened the real Android upgrade/data-loss probe for older published source trees whose Gradle build succeeds but whose Flutter CLI cannot discover/copy the generated flavored APK. The gate now independently locates and validates a signed x86_64 `directRelease` APK across Flutter and native Gradle output directories, while still failing on genuine build/signing failures.
- Replaced the probe's deliberate offline-first `flutter pub get` attempt with normal dependency resolution so a missing cached package such as `google_fonts` is fetched immediately instead of producing a misleading failure first.
- Kept the emulator in-place upgrade, release signing, Flutter quality gate, Worker integrity gate, and Play 16 KB validation mandatory.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker metadata to `1.0.1233+277`.

## [1.0.1232] - 2026-10-02

- Fixed the release test suite after the 1.0.1231 hardening pass without weakening any production release gate.
- Restored consistent tap-outside keyboard dismissal, adaptive copy/paste context menus, and interactive text selection for every app `TextField`.
- Restored the stronger animated net-balance sparkline stroke while preserving reduced-motion behavior.
- Updated brittle source-contract tests to validate the current Plan purchase flow, native Android background update scheduler, parameterized loan-visibility projection, fixed-size popup architecture, Worker administrator UI, splash branding, and fork-protected release jobs.
- Corrected transaction local-first and rich-note tests so they validate the intended controller behavior/data instead of matching unrelated methods or map identity.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker metadata to `1.0.1232+276`.

## [1.0.1231] - 2026-10-02

### Fixed

- Stabilized the mandatory Flutter release test gate against the current Yutaka UI architecture: editable-text scroll contracts now accept the shared text/time-picker overscroll guard, onboarding widget tests no longer wait forever on the intentionally repeating onboarding glyph, and the slidable/tab-stage contract now validates the current transaction quick-menu overlay instead of the removed standalone Plan button.
- Made transaction date-range round-trip tests validate the preserved instant rather than `DateTime.isUtc` metadata, matching Yutaka's epoch-millisecond SQLite storage without changing production timestamp storage or migration behavior.
- Kept all release gates mandatory and bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker metadata to `1.0.1231+275`.

## [1.0.1230] - 2026-10-02

### Fixed

- Fixed the Android release quality gate so `flutter analyze --no-pub` no longer fails on contract-test string interpolation, the Worker deployment credential-store override, the loan preference notifier, stale imports/hides, and the reported lint issues.
- Fixed the Worker data-loss regression harness by injecting the local libSQL test client into the Worker request handler. Production requests still construct the standard Turso web client, while tests can now exercise the real Worker sync/recovery routes against a local `file:` database without sending that unsupported URL through `@libsql/client/web`.
- Kept the Android upgrade/data-loss and Worker integrity release gates mandatory; no release check was weakened or bypassed.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker release metadata to `1.0.1230+274`.

## [1.0.1229] - 2026-10-02

### Fixed

- Added a real Android in-place upgrade data-loss release gate. CI now checks out the previous published stable Yutaka source, builds previous/current x86_64 release-signed probe APKs with the same permanent certificate, seeds a real app-private SQLite database, installs the new package with `adb install -r` without uninstalling or clearing data, and verifies finance/sync sentinel records after offline startup and after connectivity returns.
- Added a Worker data-integrity release gate that runs TypeScript typechecking plus the full Worker test suite, and expanded destructive-reset recovery coverage across accounts, categories, transactions, budgets, plans, notes, subscriptions, loan contacts, loans, and repayments so cloud-side data loss blocks the Android release too.
- The Android APK/AAB matrix now depends on this upgrade gate, so a failed upgrade-preservation check blocks Play and direct Android release artifacts.
- Expanded release workflow path filters so Android validation-script and regression-test changes also trigger the release pipeline.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker release metadata to `1.0.1229+273`.

## [1.0.1228] - 2026-10-02

### Changed
- Added mandatory Google Play 16 KB page-size validation to the final signed AAB: CI now requires `PAGE_ALIGNMENT_16K` from bundletool and checks every bundled ARM64/x86_64 ELF library for 16 KB LOAD and GNU_RELRO alignment before artifact upload.
- Explicitly kept Android native libraries on modern non-legacy JNI packaging so AGP 9 can preserve 16 KB ZIP alignment, while retaining NDK r28's default 16 KB ELF alignment.
- Added regression coverage for the 16 KB Play release gate and bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker release metadata to `1.0.1228+272`.

## [1.0.1227] - 2026-10-02

### Changed
- Added a mandatory Android release quality gate that runs `flutter analyze --no-pub` and the complete `flutter test --no-pub` suite before any Android APK or Google Play AAB matrix build can start.
- Added a regression contract that verifies Android release artifacts remain dependent on the quality gate.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker release metadata to `1.0.1227+271`.

## [1.0.1226] - 2026-10-01

- Removed the legacy destructive Worker `POST /v1/sync/replace` behavior; old clients now receive HTTP 410 instead of being able to delete an account's cloud sync entities.
- Added Worker-side recovery for legacy `__reset__` history so records that existed before an old replace are restored when they were merely omitted, while explicit post-reset deletes remain authoritative.
- Restricted Worker sync pushes to Yutaka's known entity types, preventing legacy or malformed clients from injecting new `__reset__` operations.
- Updated the Flutter merge path to recover legacy reset history non-destructively and queue recovered records back to the Worker.
- Hardened remote delete handling so a stale cloud tombstone cannot erase a newer or still-pending local transaction/entity during upgrade, login, restore, or merge sync.
- Added regression coverage for destructive replace blocking, reset-history recovery, explicit-delete precedence, and preserved cloud state.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker release metadata to `1.0.1226+270`.

## [1.0.1225] - 2026-10-01

- Added a public Google Play account-deletion gateway at `docs/delete-account/` that works without installing Yutaka and redirects users directly to their own self-hosted Worker's authenticated `/delete-account` portal.
- Added a GitHub Pages deployment workflow for Yutaka's public privacy and account-deletion pages, and changed the in-app public links to the stable Pages URLs.
- Kept usernames and passwords off the central Yutaka page: only the Worker URL is entered there, while credentials remain between the user and their own Worker.
- Added regression coverage for the public deletion page, stable URLs, and Pages deployment contract.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker release metadata to `1.0.1225+269`.

## [1.0.1224] - 2026-10-01

- Fixed the cross-platform release compile failure caused by the backup file picker referencing `backupExtension` outside `BackupService`; the save dialog now uses the scoped compile-time constant `BackupService.backupExtension`.
- Added regression coverage so the Yutaka backup picker keeps the scoped extension reference while legacy `.koinlybackup` restore compatibility remains intact.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker release metadata to `1.0.1224+268`.

## [1.0.1223] - 2026-10-01

- Fully rebranded the application, source package, self-hosted Worker, release artifacts, documentation, repository links, desktop metadata, notification channels, backup/report naming, and user-facing copy from **Koinly** to **Yutaka**.
- Renamed the Android application ID/namespace to `com.yutaka.siam`, Dart package to `yutaka`, release artifacts to `Yutaka-*`, and GitHub workflow guards/links to `Chowdhury-Siam/Yutaka`.
- Replaced the old K-shaped app/launcher/splash/notification branding with a new Y-shaped Yutaka mark while retaining the existing multicolor visual language.
- New backups use `.yutakabackup` and Yutaka filenames/folders. Restore remains backward-compatible with existing `.koinlybackup` files, and the client can recognize an already-deployed legacy sync Worker long enough to migrate/redeploy it.
- Kept the existing Firebase backend resource identifiers in `google-services.json` because those IDs are allocated by Firebase and cannot be renamed safely in source; the Android client package entry now matches `com.yutaka.siam`.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker release metadata to `1.0.1223+267`.

## [1.0.1222] - 2026-10-01

- Disabled Android OS-managed Auto Backup for Yutaka app-private data so financial records, credentials, preferences, databases, and local files are not silently copied by the platform backup service.
- Added explicit Android 11-and-lower full-backup exclusions and Android 12+ cloud-backup/device-transfer exclusions for every supported app-private backup domain, covering OEM/device-transfer cases where `allowBackup=false` alone may not be sufficient.
- Kept Yutaka's user-controlled Local backup file, restore, Telegram, Google Drive, and report/export workflows unchanged.
- Added regression and CI guards so Android platform backup cannot be accidentally re-enabled in a future release.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker release metadata to `1.0.1222+266`.

## [1.0.1221] - 2026-10-01

- Removed broad Android photo/video and legacy storage permissions; profile media now relies on the scoped system file picker and receives access only to the user-selected item.
- Added a Play-flavor manifest guard that strips media/storage permissions even if a transitive plugin declares them.
- Removed `REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS` from the common/Play manifest. Google Play builds now open Android's general battery-optimization settings instead of requesting direct exemption.
- Kept the app-specific battery exemption only in the direct-distribution flavor, preserving background-worker controls for sideloaded builds without exposing the restricted permission to Google Play.
- Added regression coverage for Play/direct permission separation and scoped profile-media selection.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker release metadata to `1.0.1221+265`.

## [1.0.1220] - 2026-10-01

- Rebuilt the end-of-period financial health review as a responsive full-screen modal on phones/short windows so the monthly/yearly report is never scaled down to unreadable text.
- Kept the review header and actions fixed while the financial summary scrolls at normal size, with a centered large-screen presentation for tablets and desktop.
- Reduced the review action height and improved compact header/progress layout for narrow screens.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker release metadata to `1.0.1220+264`.

## [1.0.1219] - 2026-10-01

- Fixed Android release builds failing in `:file_picker:checkReleaseAarMetadata` because the old `file_picker` Android module compiled against API 34 while `flutter_plugin_android_lifecycle` requires API 36.
- Upgraded `file_picker` to `10.3.10`, which inherits Flutter's `compileSdkVersion`, supports Gradle 9, preserves Yutaka's existing `FilePicker.platform` API, and includes the maintained Android security fixes from the 10.3.x line.
- Added a CI compatibility guard that verifies the resolved `file_picker` Android module inherits Flutter's compile SDK before building the Play AAB or direct APKs.
- Updated dependency-cache invalidation so changes to either `pubspec.yaml` or `pubspec.lock` refresh the cached packages.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker release metadata to `1.0.1219+263`.

## [1.0.1218] - 2026-10-01

- Fixed direct ARM32/ARM64 GitHub Actions packaging by matching Flutter's actual flavored split-APK filenames (`app-armeabi-v7a-direct-release.apk` and `app-arm64-v8a-direct-release.apk`).
- Added fail-fast artifact discovery diagnostics so a future Flutter output-name change reports the APKs that were actually generated instead of failing with a vague `cp` error.
- Upgraded the Android build toolchain to Gradle `9.1.0`, Android Gradle Plugin `9.0.1`, and Kotlin Gradle Plugin `2.3.20`.
- Added Flutter's AGP 9 compatibility flags (`android.newDsl=false` and `android.builtInKotlin=false`) while Yutaka and its plugin graph still use the legacy Kotlin Gradle Plugin path.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker release metadata to `1.0.1218+262`.

## [1.0.1217] - 2026-09-30

- Replaced the placeholder privacy copy with a complete in-app Privacy Policy and added a dedicated **Settings > Privacy & data** screen.
- Made Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics opt-in per device and disabled both collection paths by default.
- Explicitly removed the Android advertising-ID permission because Yutaka has no advertising SDK.
- Added a public `PRIVACY_POLICY.md`, static-hostable privacy-policy HTML, and a Play Console Data Safety audit checklist covering self-hosted sync, profile media, Telegram, Google Drive, Firebase telemetry, and exported reports/backups.
- Added direct privacy-policy and account-deletion information links from the app and removed the previous placeholder Privacy Policy dialog.
- Added privacy compliance regression coverage.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker release metadata to `1.0.1217+261`.

## [1.0.1216] - 2026-09-30

- Added permanent self-service sync-account deletion from Settings > Account & sync, protected by the current password and an explicit `DELETE` confirmation.
- Kept local device data by default during cloud-account deletion, with a separate opt-in to erase the local offline copy.
- Added the Worker-hosted `/delete-account` browser flow so users can delete their account without reinstalling Yutaka.
- Account deletion now removes synchronized finance rows, profile media, sessions/devices, backup schedules, and stored Telegram/Google Drive credentials for that account.
- Administrator self-deletion invalidates administrator sessions and deployment-recovery secrets; the oldest remaining account becomes administrator, or a final-account deletion resets the Worker to first-user registration.
- Administrator self-deletion also removes that Worker's cached Cloudflare/Turso deployment credentials from the deleting device secure store.
- Added a standalone account-deletion guide that can be published at a stable public URL for the Google Play account-deletion disclosure.
- Added Worker and Flutter regression coverage for the account-deletion contract and advertised the capability in Worker health checks.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker release metadata to `1.0.1216+260`.

## [1.0.1215] - 2026-09-30

- Replaced the active SF Pro typography stack with Inter across the Flutter application.
- Added the maintained `google_fonts` Inter integration with system fallbacks so Android/Play builds no longer depend on Apple SF Pro font names.
- Updated the self-hosted Worker administration page to use an Inter-first, non-Apple system fallback stack while keeping the page self-contained.
- Updated typography regression/visual-test coverage for Inter.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker release metadata to `1.0.1215+259`.

## [1.0.1214] - 2026-09-30

- Locked Android releases to Android 16 / API 36 with `compileSdk = 36` and `targetSdk = 36`.
- Added a GitHub Actions guard that fails the Android release before compilation if either SDK target is accidentally lowered, while continuing to provision Android Platform 36 and Build Tools 36.0.0.
- Added an Android API 36 regression contract and documented the Play/direct API level in the build instructions.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker release metadata to `1.0.1214+258`.

## [1.0.1213] - 2026-09-30

- Split Android updates into two distribution channels: Google Play builds now use the official Google Play In-App Updates flow, while direct/sideloaded APK builds retain the GitHub APK updater.
- Removed `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES` and the APK FileProvider from the Google Play manifest; they are now present only in the `direct` Android flavor.
- Disabled GitHub background update checks/notifications in Google Play builds so Play is the authoritative source of update availability.
- Added a signed Google Play `.aab` artifact to the release workflow while keeping direct APK artifacts separate.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker release metadata to `1.0.1213+257`.

## [1.0.1212] - 2026-09-30

- Removed the standalone date-range/calendar button from the Transaction page top app bar.
- Date filtering remains available through the existing transaction filtering/date-range flows; only the redundant top action was removed.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker release metadata to `1.0.1212+256`.

## [1.0.1211] - 2026-09-30

- Reworked the New/Edit loan editor to use the same compact action pattern as transactions.
- Replaced the separate loan start-date and start-time buttons with a single `Time • Date` action that opens a focused popup for both values.
- Replaced the inline Interest section with an `Interest` action that opens the existing None/Simple/Compound, rate, and accrual/compounding configuration in a dedicated popup.
- Kept the loan due-date controls separate so the repayment deadline remains independent from the loan start timestamp.
- Added a regression contract for the compact loan controls and bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker release metadata to `1.0.1211+255`.

## [1.0.1210] - 2026-09-30

- Replaced the separate transaction date and time buttons with a single `Time • Date` control that opens one configuration popup while preserving single/range date and time support.
- Replaced the second transaction timing button with `Service charge`; service charge is off by default and can be configured as a fixed number or percentage.
- Service charges are persisted and synchronized with transactions. Expenses add the charge, income deducts it, and transfers charge only the source account while the destination receives the original transfer amount.
- Transaction-history PDF/TXT/XLSX and Worker-generated history reports now retain service-charge details, while transfer-volume analytics continue to use the actual transferred base amount.
- Added database migration and regression contracts for the new transaction metadata.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker release metadata to `1.0.1210+254`.

## [1.0.1209] - 2026-09-30

- Added a Settings > General > Startup page option for choosing which primary Yutaka page opens after launch.
- Users can choose Home, Analysis, Loans, Transaction, or Categories; Home remains the default for existing and new installs unless changed.
- The selected startup page is persisted with preferences without forcing an immediate navigation change while editing Settings.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker release metadata to `1.0.1209+253`.

## [1.0.1208] - 2026-09-29

- Added the same global show/hide-amount eye control used on the Home balance card to the Transaction title, Loans Portfolio header, Categories breakdown header, and Analysis cash-flow header.
- The visibility state remains shared across the app, so toggling the eye from any of these screens immediately hides or reveals monetary values everywhere that uses Yutaka amount formatting.
- Preserved the project-wide GNU GPL v3.0 license metadata and notices while carrying forward the desktop updater and floating-action-button changes.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker release metadata to `1.0.1208+252`.

## [1.0.1207] - 2026-09-29

- Removed the top-right add button from the Loans screen and moved loan creation to a bottom-right floating action button, matching the Transaction section style.
- Removed the top-right add button from Manage categories and added a bottom-right floating action button for creating categories.
- Extended PageScaffold with reusable floating action button support for pages that need Transaction-style bottom actions.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker release metadata to `1.0.1207+251`.

## [1.0.1206] - 2026-09-29

- Added in-app Linux and macOS updater flows so desktop users can download and open the correct release package directly from the update dialog instead of being sent only to the GitHub release page.
- Linux now prefers the matching AppImage when available, falls back to the portable archive, and remembers a pending downloaded package for quick reopen.
- macOS now downloads the installer package in-app, reopens pending downloaded installers, and keeps desktop update cleanup/version tracking aligned with Windows and Android.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker release metadata to `1.0.1206+250`.

## [1.0.1204] - 2026-09-28

- Fixed the Material time-picker clock popup inheriting Yutaka's app-wide always-scrollable/elastic physics, which let the otherwise fixed clock surface move or bounce.
- Time-picker dialogs now use non-scrollable physics and skip desktop elastic-scroll decoration while preserving normal hour/minute dial interaction and AM/PM controls.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker release metadata to `1.0.1204+248`.

## [1.0.1203] - 2026-09-28

- Fixed bookmarked Notes losing their pinned position after another note was edited or autosaved.
- Note ordering now always prioritizes bookmarked notes, then sorts within each group by most recently updated/created. The same ordering is enforced for database reloads, live autosave updates, and filtered Note-list results.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker release metadata to `1.0.1203+247`.

## [1.0.1202] - 2026-09-28

- Reworked the inline transaction/custom date-range selection highlight so the selected span uses a soft continuous filled band instead of thin segmented underscore-like connector lines.
- Rounded the range band cleanly at the start/end dates and at week-row boundaries while keeping the existing endpoint circles and date-selection behavior.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker release metadata to `1.0.1202+246`.

## [1.0.1201] - 2026-09-28

- Fixed the Add transaction dialog getting stuck on the three-dot saving loader after the local transaction had already been written.
- The root cause was the submit Future waiting for a full application reload, including unrelated category repair, starter-account cleanup, notes/subscriptions/budgets, and loan repository reads; background database work could delay that entire chain.
- Transaction add/edit/delete now refresh only accounts and transactions after the local database mutation, then queue cloud sync separately without awaiting any network request.
- Reduced sync-outbox work for ordinary transaction mutations by queuing only the accounts whose balances were actually touched (with a defensive full-account fallback if prior state is unavailable).
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker release metadata to `1.0.1201+245`.

## [1.0.1200] - 2026-09-28

- Removed the Note editor's `Select title` action from the three-dot menu.
- Kept normal title text selection available through the platform text-selection controls.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker release metadata to `1.0.1200+244`.

## [1.0.1199] - 2026-09-28

- Fixed Note editor text selection so Android highlights stay tightly aligned to the selected glyphs instead of stretching through blank line space.
- Restored enough compact line leading for selection drag handles to sit cleanly between adjacent lines.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker release metadata to `1.0.1199+243`.

## [1.0.1198] - 2026-09-28

- Made the Note editor match the compact mobile reference more closely: reduced title/body typography, tightened line height and margins, and increased usable writing space.
- Restored the separate calendar button on phone layouts, reduced date/time/tag controls, and made the top action row more compact.
- Removed the oversized tonal background from the three-dot menu trigger while keeping the same Note menu actions.
- Bumped synchronized app/Android/Worker release metadata to `1.0.1198+242`.

## [1.0.1197] - 2026-09-28

- Note list cards now show only the note title and metadata; note body/content previews are no longer rendered on the Note screen.
- Note search still indexes both titles and note content, so hiding the preview does not reduce search capability.
- Bumped synchronized app/Worker release metadata to `1.0.1197+241`.

## [1.0.1195] - 2026-09-28

- Notes now save automatically while the user types or changes note metadata; the Note editor no longer requires a manual Save action.
- Added immediate local persistence with a coalesced cloud-sync outbox update so rapid edits keep the newest note state without reloading every finance table on each keystroke.
- Note edits are flushed when leaving the editor and when the app becomes inactive, paused, hidden, or detached, reducing the chance of losing the latest text when the app is closed or backgrounded.
- Added stable IDs for newly created notes, safe blank-new-note cleanup, and autosave/delete race protection.
- Bumped synchronized app/Worker release metadata to `1.0.1195+239`.

## [1.0.1194] - 2026-09-28

- Added per-account removal controls to the Account & sync account switcher. Removing a saved account clears only its local saved login; cloud account data remains untouched.
- Account switching and sign-out are now available while Restore cloud copy is running. Yutaka cancels the active network sync, waits for any in-flight local database write to reach a safe boundary, then performs the account transition.
- Bumped synchronized app/Worker release metadata to `1.0.1194+238`.

## [1.0.1193] - 2026-09-25

- Fixed Notes not appearing on other devices signed into the same self-hosted sync account: notes now participate in incremental upload, remote pull, and realtime update notifications.
- Creating, editing, bookmarking, changing draft status, and deleting notes now enqueue the corresponding cloud operations.
- Added atomic one-time migration for notes saved by old local-only versions. Existing local notes are queued on the next authenticated push without duplicating already-pending or downloaded entries.
- Kept newer cloud deletions from being overwritten by a stale pre-upgrade note during conflict resolution.
- Included Notes in Telegram and Google Drive cloud-generated `.yutakabackup` snapshots (redeploy Worker to enable backup inclusion).
- Added regression contracts for the end-to-end Note sync path and synchronized app/Worker version metadata to `1.0.1193+237`.

## [1.0.1192] - 2026-09-25

- Removed the Underline (U) and Quote actions from the Note editor toolbar.
- Existing underlined notes and previously inserted quote characters remain readable and unchanged.
- Synchronized application and bundled Worker version metadata to `1.0.1192+236`.

## [1.0.1191] - 2026-09-25

- Fixed Note editor toolbar formatting losing or collapsing the selected text on Android; bold, italic and other styles can now be combined on the same selection.
- Fixed formatting being inherited incorrectly when typing after moving the cursor or replacing a different styled range.
- Added live selected-state indicators for the Note editor's inline formatting buttons and preserved IME composition styling.
- Added focused formatting-selection regression tests and synchronized application and bundled Worker version metadata to `1.0.1191+235`.

## [1.0.1190] - 2026-09-25

- Fixed Note editor formatting so bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, highlight, link-style, and inline code render directly instead of inserting visible Markdown/HTML markers.
- Added persistent rich-text range storage for notes while keeping note search and previews plain-text friendly.
- Updated quote and bullet actions to use visible typographic markers rather than raw Markdown prefixes.
- Synchronized application and bundled Worker version metadata to `1.0.1190+234`.

## [1.0.1189] - 2026-09-25

- Fixed the Note editor phone layout with compact button, text, and chip sizing so the date/time row no longer clips.
- Synchronized application and bundled Worker version metadata to `1.0.1189+233`.

## [1.0.1188] - 2026-09-24

- Removed the H1-H6 heading controls from the Note editor toolbar.
- Synchronized application and bundled Worker version metadata to `1.0.1188+232`.

## [1.0.1187] - 2026-09-24

- Fixed the Note editor dots menu so it opens as a compact icon menu instead of the oversized checked popup.
- Synchronized application and bundled Worker version metadata to `1.0.1187+231`.

## [1.0.1186] - 2026-09-24

- Made the Note editor controls functional: date chips open date picking, time chips open time picking, emoji opens a picker, and the tag/bookmark action gives feedback.
- Synchronized application and bundled Worker version metadata to `1.0.1186+230`.

## [1.0.1185] - 2026-09-24

- Updated the Note editor to match the June-style full-screen canvas with a large title prompt, date/time chips, tag action, hidden formatting tools, and a dots menu.
- Synchronized application and bundled Worker version metadata to `1.0.1185+229`.

## [1.0.1184] - 2026-09-24

- Removed the visible `is:Bookmarked` and `is:Draft` filter chips from the Note list.
- Synchronized application and bundled Worker version metadata to `1.0.1184+228`.

## [1.0.1183] - 2026-09-24

- Added June-style Note list features: search, Recent/More entries grouping, dated note cards, bookmark toggles, and draft/publish swipe actions.
- Notes now persist bookmark and draft state in the local database and local backup payload.
- Synchronized application and bundled Worker version metadata to `1.0.1183+227`.

## [1.0.1182] - 2026-09-24

- Changed Note add/edit from a centered popup to a full-screen editor page.
- Added June-style markdown editing controls for bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, highlight, links, quotes, bullets, inline code, headings, checklist insertion, emoji insertion, undo, and redo.
- Synchronized application and bundled Worker version metadata to `1.0.1182+226`.

## [1.0.1181] - 2026-09-24

- Added a Note feature from the transaction quick menu with local note list, add/edit popup, swipe edit/delete, and local backup/restore support.
- Reworked the centered date range picker to draw the selected span inline across calendar rows, making the chosen start and end dates visually connected.
- Fixed the new range calendar animation to use Yutaka's existing `AppMotion.fast` duration.
- Synchronized application and bundled Worker version metadata to `1.0.1181+225`.

## [1.0.1180] - 2026-09-22

- Added saved self-hosted Sync Workers and saved account profiles so one installation can switch between multiple Worker/account combinations.
- Account switching now stages the target account first, downloads its full cloud history, creates a safety backup, then replaces local account-scoped finance data, preferences, profile media, credentials, and server cursor without using the normal merge sync path.
- Added Account & sync controls to switch accounts, add another account, validate a Worker, and create-and-switch to a new account without adopting the current local dataset.
- Stored automatic Worker deployment credentials per Worker while preserving legacy credential fallback.
- Fixed the Account & sync sign-out confirmation so the long keep/clear actions are centered, equal-width, and vertically aligned on phones instead of wrapping into a staggered right-aligned layout.
- Synchronized application and bundled Worker version metadata to `1.0.1180+224`.

## [1.0.1178] - 2026-09-21

- Collapsed the Self-hosted Sync Worker controls by default for signed-in accounts and added an animated top-right Worker settings toggle.
- Replaced the signed-in sync timestamp card title with the configured Cloudflare Worker name (or custom Worker host).
- Added a centered sign-out choice to keep the cloud account's data locally or clear only the device copy; either option leaves all cloud data untouched.
- Clearing local data after sign-out also removes local profile media, filters, defaults, and finance rows without queuing cloud deletions.
- Synchronized application and bundled Worker version metadata to `1.0.1178+222`.

## [1.0.1177] - 2026-09-21

- Added optional reminders to Plan items. Users can enable a reminder while adding or editing a plan and choose its date and time.
- Plan reminder timestamps are stored with the planned purchase, included in backup/cloud synchronization, restored on existing devices, and re-scheduled after sync or app restart.
- Plan cards show the configured reminder, and buying/deleting a plan automatically removes its pending notification.
- Added a dedicated Android notification channel for Plan reminders with exact-alarm fallback behavior.
- Migrated existing databases safely with a nullable `reminder_on` column; existing Plan items remain unchanged with reminders off.
- Synchronized application and bundled Worker version metadata to `1.0.1177+221`.

## [1.0.1176] - 2026-09-21

- Fixed profile-photo flashing when returning to Categories by keeping the decoded static avatar image live in Flutter's image cache across tab rebuilds.
- Profile photo widgets now render the existing fallback avatar while an image frame is decoding instead of exposing an empty circular field.
- Profile-media replacement and cloud download prime the new avatar before switching the cached provider, preventing navigation and sync refreshes from clearing the visible photo first.
- Synchronized application and bundled Worker version metadata to `1.0.1176+220`.

## [1.0.1175] - 2026-09-21

- Fixed the Android status-bar notification icon appearing as a solid white circle by adding a dedicated monochrome Yutaka `K` notification icon.
- Applied the status icon to daily expense reminders, loan reminders, Flutter update notifications, native background update notifications, and Android default notification metadata.
- Kept the full-color launcher/adaptive icon unchanged; only Android's small notification icon now uses the required transparent monochrome resource.
- Synchronized application and bundled Worker version metadata to `1.0.1175+219`.

## [1.0.1174] - 2026-09-20

- Added a persistent Transaction sort control with newest/oldest, category, amount, and title ordering. Changing the sort rebuilds a fresh list immediately, so existing transactions are reorganized without rewriting financial data.
- Fixed legacy transaction ordering by using the visible transaction start timestamp (`createdOn`) rather than historical range-end metadata (`endOn`/`listOn`) for date sorting.
- Applied the selected transaction ordering consistently to category transaction lists and synchronized the preference through Yutaka settings sync.
- Synchronized application and bundled Worker version metadata to `1.0.1174+218`.

## [1.0.1173] - 2026-09-18

- Fixed transaction history ordering so the complete transaction date/time is sorted newest-first.
- Transactions on the same day now correctly show late-evening entries above afternoon entries.
- Synchronized application and bundled Worker version metadata to `1.0.1173+217`.

## [1.0.1172] - 2026-09-18

- Fixed transaction time ordering so each calendar day remains newest-first while transactions inside that day are listed chronologically from earlier to later.
- Transactions at 12:57 PM now correctly appear above transactions at 11:01 PM when they share the same date.
- Applied the ordering in the shared filtered transaction list so Transaction and category transaction screens stay consistent, with deterministic tie-breaking for identical timestamps.
- Synchronized application and bundled Worker version metadata to `1.0.1172+216`.

## [1.0.1171] - 2026-09-18

- Fixed the desktop **Category spending** hover field so its hover/focus surface spans the complete category row width instead of stopping at the card's horizontal content inset.
- Preserved the existing 18 px content alignment by moving horizontal spacing into each `ListTile`, while keeping the card's vertical breathing room unchanged.
- Kept the shared amount-column progress-width fix from 1.0.1170 intact and synchronized application and bundled Worker version metadata to `1.0.1171+215`.

## [1.0.1170] - 2026-09-16

- Fixed the Home **Category spending** layout so every progress track uses the same available width regardless of the formatted amount length.
- Added a shared dynamically measured amount column so longer currency values no longer shorten only their own progress track on Windows or responsive layouts.
- Synchronized application and bundled Worker version metadata to `1.0.1170+214`.

## [1.0.1169] - 2026-09-16

- Fixed returning users being left on first-run onboarding after a successful existing-account login.
- Existing-account authentication now marks onboarding complete in the controller, independent of the login screen route.
- Added startup recovery for valid persisted sync sessions created by older builds, while preserving the Restore/Start new choice for newly registered accounts.
- Synchronized application and bundled Worker version metadata to `1.0.1169+213`.

## [1.0.1168] - 2026-09-16

- Show an explicit `Administrator` title under the first account in both the in-app Worker Profile and the `/profile` website.
- Make administrator identity strictly follow the earliest account in the Worker database and repair stale cached administrator ownership automatically.
- Return `administratorUserId` from the profile accounts API and pin the administrator to the top of the account list for deterministic rendering.
- Added backward-compatible administrator detection for a single-account Worker when talking to an older profile API.
- Synchronized application and bundled Worker version metadata to `1.0.1168+212`.

## [1.0.1167] - 2026-09-16

- Moved Android closed-app update checks to a native WorkManager worker so update notifications no longer depend on starting a headless Flutter/plugin isolate.
- Added an in-app Worker Profile administration screen with administrator login, account creation, username changes, password changes, account deletion, and refresh/sign-out actions.
- Profile now appears only when the saved self-hosted Worker endpoint has been validated; managed-registration links open the same in-app Profile screen.
- Synchronized application and bundled Worker version metadata to `1.0.1167+211`.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.1166] - 2026-09-16

- Fixed cross-platform release compilation in `worker_deployment.dart` by using the namespaced `dart:math` `min` function when batching Turso schema statements.
- Synchronized application and bundled Worker version metadata to `1.0.1166+210`.

## [1.0.1165] - 2026-09-16

- Added **Settings > Profile** for validated self-hosted Workers. It opens that Worker's `/profile` page so users can sign in and manage their Worker account from the app settings flow.
- The **Profile** setting is hidden until a Cloudflare Worker URL has been successfully validated and saved through **Account & sync**, so an unconfigured app never shows a broken profile destination.
- Synchronized application and bundled Worker version metadata to `1.0.1165+209`.

## [1.0.1164] - 2026-09-16

- The first Yutaka account created in the Worker database is now the `/profile` administrator; separate `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` deployment credentials were removed from in-app and GitHub deployments.
- Added **Change username** to the Worker account manager. Renaming an account preserves its user ID and synchronized data, and renaming the first account keeps its administrator role.
- Prevented deletion of the first-account administrator so Worker administration and encrypted deployment recovery cannot be orphaned.
- Updated deployment recovery payloads to version 2 so Cloudflare, Turso, JWT, Worker URL, and version values can be restored after reinstall when the first account signs in, without storing separate administrator credentials.
- Restyled the Worker `/profile` website to the current Yutaka app palette, including the charcoal dark surfaces, light surfaces, and `#00BD91` accent.
- Fixed automatic and manual Worker redeployments failing with `migration must include a new_tag because old_tag is set`. Code-only updates now send the existing Durable Object migration tag as both `old_tag` and `new_tag`, including the one-time migration-state retry.
- Added mocked HTTP deployment tests covering existing Workers, first deployments, migration-state recovery, declarative exports, and automatic updates.
- Synchronized application and bundled Worker version metadata to `1.0.1164+208`.

## [1.0.1163] - 2026-09-16

- Fixed Android reminder notifications not firing because the scheduled-notification receiver components required by `flutter_local_notifications` 16+ were missing from the app manifest.
- Fixed reminder times being interpreted as UTC by explicitly binding the `timezone` package to Android's current device time zone, with an offset fallback for OEM-specific zone IDs.
- Daily and loan reminders now use exact `AlarmManager` delivery while allowed, request Android's **Alarms & reminders** special access when a user enables the daily reminder, and safely fall back to inexact allow-while-idle delivery if exact access is denied.
- Existing enabled daily reminders are recreated on app startup, repairing schedules made by older builds and schedules invalidated by package replacement.
- Synchronized application and bundled Worker version metadata to `1.0.1163+207`.

## [1.0.1162] - 2026-09-15

- Added **Settings > Permissions > Ignore Battery Optimization** on Android, with live permission-state refresh when returning from Android settings.
- Added a native Android battery-optimization settings bridge so users can mark Yutaka unrestricted and reduce background update/subscription delays caused by Doze or aggressive OEM power management.
- Notification-enabled settings now request Android notification permission again when the user explicitly enables them.
- Removed the unused exact-alarm permission and stripped generated/machine-specific Flutter and Android local configuration from the packaged repository.
- Synchronized application and bundled Worker version metadata to `1.0.1162+206`.

## [1.0.1161] - 2026-09-15

- Added encrypted deployment-value recovery for Workers deployed from Yutaka. After reinstalling the app, paste and validate the same Worker URL and sign in with the first sync account; Yutaka restores the saved Cloudflare/Turso/JWT deployment profile to secure storage automatically.
- Restricted deployment recovery to the first sync account and encrypted the remote recovery payload before storing it in Turso. The raw administrator password is still never stored or recoverable.
- Kept automatic Worker updates working after reinstall by restoring the deployment profile before checking the Worker version.
- Updated the README and Worker documentation and synchronized application/Worker version metadata to `1.0.1161+205`.

## [1.0.1160] - 2026-09-15

- Fresh self-hosted Workers now allow the first Yutaka sync account to be created directly from **Account & sync**, even when `/profile` administrator credentials are configured.
- After the first sync account exists, later app registration remains administrator-managed and continues to redirect account creation to `/profile`.
- Removed the prefilled `yutaka-sync` Worker name and `worker-admin` administrator username from the in-app deployment form; both fields now start empty on a fresh deployment.
- Updated the README and Worker documentation for the first-account flow and synchronized application/Worker version metadata to `1.0.1160+204`.

## [1.0.1159] - 2026-09-14

- Fixed in-app Cloudflare Worker updates failing when an existing `SyncHub` Durable Object had already applied the `v1-realtime-sync-hub` migration.
- Yutaka now reads the latest Cloudflare Worker version detail to recover the currently applied Durable Object migration tag and sends it back as `old_tag` on subsequent uploads, preserving the existing namespace and data.
- Added a one-time safe retry when Cloudflare reports a migration-tag precondition mismatch, using Cloudflare's expected tag instead of requiring the Worker to be deleted or recreated.
- Synchronized application and Worker version metadata to `1.0.1159+203`.

## [1.0.1158] - 2026-09-14

- Fixed first-time in-app Cloudflare deployments being reported as failed when the `workers.dev` route needed longer than one minute to finish propagating.
- Worker health verification now waits substantially longer, reports intermediate propagation status, and preserves the actual HTTP/database/schema/runtime reason when a deployment never becomes healthy.
- In-app deployments now bind Turso's equivalent HTTPS endpoint to the Cloudflare Worker runtime while continuing to accept the canonical `libsql://...turso.io` URL in the setup form.
- Synchronized application and Worker version metadata to `1.0.1158+202`.

## [1.0.1157] - 2026-09-14

- Fixed in-app Turso validation incorrectly rejecting valid database credentials with HTTP 404. Yutaka now validates Turso through the same authenticated Hrana `/v2/pipeline` endpoint used for schema provisioning, using a read-only `SELECT 1` connection check.
- Improved Turso deployment errors so authentication failures, missing database endpoints, and other HTTP failures are reported separately.
- Added a deployment contract regression check that prevents the unsupported Turso `/version` probe from returning.
- Synchronized application and Worker version metadata to `1.0.1157+201`.

## [1.0.1156] - 2026-09-14

- Added automatic self-hosted Worker updates for Workers deployed through **Settings > Account & sync > Deploy Database**.
- The app can now securely retain the Cloudflare/Turso deployment profile on-device, while storing only the derived administrator password verifier rather than the raw administrator password.
- On the first launch after a newer Yutaka app update, Yutaka compares the active Worker's reported version with the Worker bundled into the app and redeploys only when the bundled Worker is newer.
- Added Worker version reporting to `/health`, automatic update progress/error reporting in **Account & sync**, retry support, and a control to forget saved deployment credentials.
- GitHub-based Worker deployment now verifies that its Worker version matches the app release version before deployment.
- Updated the README and Worker documentation for the automatic redeployment flow and synchronized application version metadata to `1.0.1156+200`.

## [1.0.1155] - 2026-09-14

- Added **Settings > Account & sync > Deploy Database** as a second self-hosted Worker deployment path alongside GitHub Actions.
- Added an in-app deployment guide and form for Cloudflare Worker name/account/token, Turso database URL/token, JWT secret, and Worker administrator credentials.
- In-app deployment now validates Cloudflare and Turso, applies the current Turso schema and legacy migrations, derives the administrator password verifier locally, uploads the bundled Worker, enables the workers.dev route, configures the five-minute scheduler, and waits for the full Worker health contract.
- Deployment failures are shown directly on the deployment page; successful deployment automatically returns the Worker URL to **Account & sync** and validates/enables it.
- Deployment credentials entered in the app are not persisted; official release builds now embed a deployable Worker bundle generated from the current `cloud/worker` source.
- Updated the README for both supported Worker deployment methods and synchronized application version metadata to `1.0.1155+199`.

## [1.0.1154] - 2026-09-14

- Refreshed the public README so it documents the current Yutaka experience instead of calling out features that were removed in earlier versions.
- Updated self-hosted account password-reset documentation to describe the current `/profile` administrator flow directly.
- Removed stale README wording around the retired in-app recovery flow and legacy email-login migration.
- Simplified credential and Analytics documentation to describe where current controls live without listing removed UI elements.
- Corrected the README profile-media security note to match authenticated Worker media synchronization.
- Synchronized application version metadata to `1.0.1154+198`.

## [1.0.1153] - 2026-09-14

- Removed the extra transaction-history explanatory copy from Analytics export UI.
- Synchronized application version metadata to `1.0.1153+197`.

## [1.0.1152] - 2026-09-14

- Simplified **Archive > Local backup file > Local** so its outside status now shows only **On** or **Off**, matching the cloud backup indicators.
- Synchronized application version metadata to `1.0.1152+196`.

## [1.0.1151] - 2026-09-14

- Renamed **Local backup File** to **Local backup file** in Archive.
- Renamed the Archive **Cloud** section to **Analytics backup**, and renamed the analytics **Cloud Backup** entry/page to **Cloud**.
- Added outside **On/Off** indicators to both Archive cloud entries: backup-file cloud delivery and analytics-report cloud delivery. The indicators refresh from the Worker and refresh again after returning from either cloud settings page.
- Synchronized application version metadata to `1.0.1151+195`.

## [1.0.1150] - 2026-09-14

- Reduced Android release wall-clock time by building the universal, ARM32, and ARM64 APKs concurrently instead of rebuilding the ABI outputs sequentially in one job, while using the GitHub runner's preinstalled Android toolchain and cache-first Dart dependency resolution.
- Reduced macOS release overhead with separated dependency/build caches, deduplicated parallel AppIcon generation, disabled compiler indexing during release compilation, and concurrent fast-compression DMG/ZIP packaging.
- Preserved the existing three standalone Android APKs and universal Intel + Apple Silicon macOS release outputs.
- Synchronized application version metadata to `1.0.1150+194`.

## [1.0.1149] - 2026-09-14

- Reorganized Archive backup-file scheduling: **Automatic backup** is now **Local backup File**, **Local Backup** is now **Local**, and **Telegram Backup** is now **Cloud**.
- Expanded **Archive > Cloud** so `.yutakabackup` files can be scheduled or uploaded manually to either Telegram or Google Drive using credentials from **Settings > Credential**.
- Added an independent Google Drive `.yutakabackup` schedule. Telegram backup, Google Drive backup, Telegram report, and Google Drive report schedules are all enforced at least 5 minutes apart.
- Google Drive backup uses the configured Drive Folder ID when present; otherwise the Worker creates/reuses a dedicated **Yutaka Backup** folder.
- Synchronized application version metadata to `1.0.1149+193`.

## [1.0.1148] - 2026-09-14

- Removed redundant helper copy from Archive backup tiles and Profile media.
- Synchronized application version metadata to `1.0.1148+192`.

## [1.0.1147] - 2026-09-14

- Renamed **Automatic local backup** to **Local Backup** throughout the active app UI and current documentation without changing backup scheduling or behavior.
- Synchronized application version metadata to `1.0.1147+191`.

## [1.0.1146] - 2026-09-14

- Removed the Google Drive Folder ID instructional helper copy from Settings > Credential without changing folder selection behavior.
- Synchronized application version metadata to `1.0.1146+190`.

## [1.0.1145] - 2026-09-14

- Removed the redundant second "Last synced" line from Settings > Account & sync; the primary sync status now shows the sync timestamp only once.
- Synchronized application version metadata to `1.0.1145+189`.

## [1.0.1144] - 2026-09-14

- Removed redundant helper/descriptive copy from reminder, theme, date-filter, credentials, Telegram Backup, Analytics, and Cloud Backup interfaces while preserving the underlying behavior and validation.
- Kept the 5-minute automatic-upload separation enforcement in the Self-Hosted Worker; only the repeated on-screen warning text was removed.
- Synchronized application version metadata to `1.0.1144+188`.

## [1.0.1143] - 2026-09-14

- Added an optional **Google Drive Folder ID** field to **Settings > Credential > Google Drive**. When set, both manual Analytics uploads and scheduled Cloud Backup reports are uploaded directly into that folder; when blank, Yutaka continues to create/reuse **Yutaka Analytics**.
- Folder IDs are validated by the Worker, custom folders are checked for accessibility/write permission during OAuth connection, and Shared Drive uploads use `supportsAllDrives`. Changing the configured folder forces a fresh Google authorization so the required scope cannot stay stale.
- Google OAuth now keeps the limited `drive.file` scope for the default Yutaka-managed folder and requests the broader Drive scope only when a user explicitly configures an existing Folder ID.
- Renamed **Automatic Telegram backup** to **Telegram Backup** throughout the active app UI and current documentation without changing its scheduling or `.yutakabackup` behavior.
- Added the `google_folder_id` Turso schema migration and synchronized application version metadata to `1.0.1143+187`.

## [1.0.1142] - 2026-09-14

- Added **PDF**, **XLSX**, and **TXT** as selectable Analytics report formats for both Summary and Transaction history exports.
- Manual Analytics download, Telegram upload, and Google Drive upload now use the selected report format and correct filename/MIME type.
- Added a per-destination file-format selector to **Settings > Archive > Cloud Backup** so Telegram and Google Drive schedules can independently generate PDF, XLSX, or TXT reports.
- Extended the Self-Hosted Sync Worker and Turso schedule schema to persist report format, generate scheduled XLSX/TXT reports, validate manual uploads by format, and default existing schedules safely to PDF.
- Preserved the existing date filters, custom ranges, schedule cadence, and pairwise five-minute separation across Telegram reports, Google Drive reports, and Telegram `.yutakabackup` uploads.
- Synchronized application version metadata to `1.0.1142+186`.

## [1.0.1141] - 2026-09-14

- Removed the redundant instructional copy from **Archive > Automatic local backup**, including the folder, retention, encrypted-file, and reopen-to-catch-up explanations.
- Replaced Android's foreground/resume-only automatic local backup behavior with a native Android WorkManager job so due local backups can be created while the Yutaka UI is closed.
- The background worker reads the current SQLite data and saved backup preferences, writes the same version-7 encrypted `.yutakabackup` format through the persisted Android Storage Access Framework folder grant, applies the existing latest-only/history retention choice, and reports last-backup/error state back to the app.
- Non-Android automatic local backup behavior remains unchanged.
- Synchronized application version metadata to `1.0.1141+185`.

## [1.0.1140] - 2026-09-14

- Replaced custom date-range flows with one centered Yutaka range popup that reuses the transaction editor's **Use range** interaction: select Start/End inside the same calendar and apply the range once.
- Applied the centered custom-range picker globally to the main date filter, Analytics, the default date filter in Settings, and automatic Analytics PDF schedules.
- Replaced the automatic PDF date-filter dropdown with the centered **Choose Date Filter** popup and added **Custom range** alongside Today, This Week, This Month, This Year, and All Time.
- Added Worker/Turso support for persisted custom start/end dates so scheduled Telegram and Google Drive PDFs use the exact selected custom range.
- Added a safe schema migration for existing `analytics_pdf_schedules` tables while preserving current schedules and the five-minute automatic-upload separation rule.
- Synchronized application version metadata to `1.0.1140+184`.

## [1.0.1139] - 2026-09-14

- Reorganized **Settings > Archive** so **Automatic local backup** and **Automatic Telegram backup** now appear together under one **Automatic backup** section.
- Kept manual **Backup** and **Load backup** together under **Local**, while **Cloud Backup** remains under **Cloud**.
- No backup behavior, credentials, schedules, or five-minute cloud-upload separation rules were changed.
- Synchronized application version metadata to `1.0.1139+183`.

## [1.0.1138] - 2026-09-14

- Removed the redundant **Telegram destination** credential/status card from **Archive > Automatic Telegram backup**.
- Automatic Telegram backup continues to use the Telegram bot credentials configured exclusively in **Settings > Credential**.
- Kept the existing credential validation, schedule controls, status, manual backup action, and five-minute automatic-upload separation rules unchanged.
- Synchronized application version metadata to `1.0.1138+182`.

## [1.0.1137] - 2026-09-14

- Reorganized Settings into **General**, **Data & cloud**, and **App** groups so related controls are easier to locate.
- Added **Settings > Credential** as the only in-app place to configure the Telegram bot token/destination and Google Drive OAuth credentials/connection.
- Added **Settings > Archive** and moved **Backup**, **Automatic local backup**, and **Load backup** out of Advanced settings.
- Moved **Automatic Telegram backup** out of Account & sync and into Archive; its page now manages only backup scheduling/status while using Telegram credentials from Settings > Credential.
- Added **Archive > Cloud Backup** for automatic Analytics PDF schedules to Telegram and Google Drive; credential editing was removed from Analytics/cloud scheduling.
- Removed the Telegram backup action from Account & sync and removed the Telegram/Drive configuration icons from the Analytics app bar. Manual Analytics PDF uploads continue to use the credentials configured in Settings > Credential.
- Preserved Worker-side pairwise minimum five-minute separation across automatic Telegram PDF, Google Drive PDF, and Telegram `.yutakabackup` schedules.
- Synchronized application version metadata to `1.0.1137+181`.

## [1.0.1136] - 2026-09-13

- Added an inline eye button to every password field in the self-hosted Worker website, including administrator sign-in, account creation, and password reset/change dialogs.
- Password visibility toggles are keyboard accessible, preserve the field value and focus, update their accessible Show/Hide label, and always reset to hidden when credential forms reopen or submit.
- Synchronized application version metadata to `1.0.1136+180`.

## [1.0.1135] - 2026-09-13

- Added configurable automatic Analytics PDF delivery schedules for both Telegram and Google Drive, with separate report type, date filter, daily/weekly/monthly cadence, and delivery time settings.
- Automatic PDFs are generated by the Self-Hosted Sync Worker from the latest synchronized Yutaka data, so scheduled delivery does not require the app to stay open.
- Enforced a minimum five-minute separation between every enabled automatic upload time: Telegram Analytics PDF, Google Drive Analytics PDF, and Telegram `.yutakabackup`. Conflicting schedules are rejected by the Worker as well as explained in the app.
- Disconnecting Google Drive now disables its automatic PDF schedule while preserving the rest of the Analytics upload configuration.
- Synchronized application version metadata to `1.0.1135+179`.

## [1.0.1134] - 2026-09-13

- Replaced the Analytics Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Yearly selector with the standard **Choose Date Filter** flow: Today, This Week, This Month, This Year, All Time, and Custom.
- Transaction history PDFs now obey the selected Analytics date filter instead of always exporting every stored transaction; selecting **All Time** restores the full-ledger behavior.
- Added a Telegram bot shortcut beside the Analytics cloud/Drive upload-settings icon.
- Updated Analytics PDF filenames, Telegram captions, empty-state text, and documentation so the selected date filter is carried through consistently.
- Synchronized application version metadata to `1.0.1134+178`.

## [1.0.1133] - 2026-09-13

- Removed the Analytics **Share PDF** action and its analytics-only share-sheet code.
- **Download PDF**, **Upload Telegram**, and **Upload Drive** remain available for both Summary and Transaction history PDF variants.
- Synchronized application version metadata to `1.0.1133+177`.

## [1.0.1132] - 2026-09-13

- Simplified the Analytics screen by keeping comparison, activity, budgets, category breakdowns, and current account snapshots in the PDF instead of duplicating them on-screen.
- Added two PDF report variants: the existing period Summary and a new complete Transaction history report containing every stored transaction.
- Added previous-period comparison details to the Summary PDF so all removed Analytics detail remains available in the exported report.
- Transaction history PDFs include totals plus each transaction's date/time, type, amount, title, category, account path, notes, and report-exclusion status, and work with download, share, Telegram, and Google Drive uploads.
- Synchronized application version metadata to `1.0.1132+176`.

## [1.0.1131] - 2026-09-13

- Fixed Self-Hosted Sync Worker TypeScript compilation with TypeScript 5.9 by keeping Analytics PDF byte arrays explicitly backed by `ArrayBuffer` before passing them to `Blob`.
- This fixes the `Uint8Array<ArrayBufferLike>` / `BlobPart` errors in Telegram and Google Drive Analytics PDF uploads.
- Synchronized application version metadata to `1.0.1131+175`.

## [1.0.1130] - 2026-09-13

- Replaced the persistent Account & sync registration error with a centered administrator-registration prompt.
- When Worker-managed registration blocks app signup, the prompt asks whether to create the account from the admin panel and offers only **Yes** and **No** actions.
- **Yes** opens the configured self-hosted Cloudflare Worker at `/profile`; **No** simply closes the prompt.
- Worker-managed registration failures no longer remain visible as a red sync error on the Account & sync status card.
- Added the `REGISTRATION_MANAGED` Worker error code while retaining message-based compatibility with older deployed Workers.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1130+174`.

## [1.0.1129] - 2026-09-13

### Removed

- Completely removed the in-app **Forgot password** flow from Account & sync.
- Removed the recovery-key popup, recovery-key rotation control, and the client-side recovery API code that existed only for in-app password recovery.
- Account password recovery is now handled from the Self-Hosted Sync Worker's `/profile` administration page.
- Kept the Worker's legacy recovery endpoints intact for backward compatibility with older Yutaka app versions.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1129+173`.

## [1.0.1128] - 2026-09-13

- Removed the requested explanatory helper text from Account & sync and Telegram backup without changing the underlying sync, account, backup, or scheduling behavior.
- Tightened spacing where the removed copy previously occupied layout space.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1128+172`.

# Changelog

## [1.0.1127] - 2026-09-13

### Fixed

- Added clear, consistent outlines to the Daily, Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly cards in the subscription Repeat picker.
- The selected repeat option now uses a stronger accent outline while unselected options retain a subtle theme-aware border.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1127+171`.

## [1.0.1126] - 2026-09-13

### Added

- Added direct **Upload Telegram** and **Upload Drive** actions to Analytics PDF reports. These now upload through the authenticated Self-Hosted Sync Worker instead of relying only on the device share sheet.
- Telegram Analytics uploads reuse the existing encrypted Telegram-backup bot token and destination, so no duplicate Telegram configuration is required and automatic Telegram backups may remain disabled.
- Added Google Drive connection settings for Analytics. Users configure their own Google OAuth Web application once, authorize their Google account in the browser, and Yutaka uploads reports into a dedicated **Yutaka Analytics** folder using the limited `drive.file` scope.
- Added Worker-side encrypted storage for the Google OAuth Client Secret and refresh token, OAuth callback handling, token refresh, Drive folder creation, and PDF upload endpoints.
- Added Worker health/deployment capability reporting for Analytics uploads and schema support for the new encrypted upload settings.

### Changed

- Account deletion now also removes stored Analytics upload credentials while leaving files already sent to Telegram or Google Drive untouched.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1126+170`.

## [1.0.1125] - 2026-09-13

### Added

- Added **Settings > Analytics** with Daily, Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly summaries. Each period reports income, expense, net cash flow, transaction activity, transfers, savings movement, loan/repayment activity, applicable budgets, top income/expense categories, and a current account-balance snapshot.
- Added previous-period comparisons and period navigation/date selection so historical summaries can be reviewed without changing the app-wide default date filter.
- Added local PDF report generation with **Download PDF** and **Share / upload** actions. The share flow uses the device share sheet so the PDF can be sent to Telegram, Google Drive, or another compatible app without adding separate cloud credentials to Yutaka.

### Changed

- Removed obsolete fallback positioning parameters from the now-static category breakdown badge widget. Static collision-packed placement and tap-to-select remain unchanged.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1125+169`.

## [1.0.1124] - 2026-09-13

### Changed

- Completely removed manual movement/dragging for the category breakdown percentage bubbles. They are now positioned only by the automatic collision-free layout and cannot be dragged with touch, mouse, or trackpad input.
- Removed the saved per-bubble drag-position state, drag gesture handlers, drag cursor treatment, and dragging visual state while preserving the existing static bubble layout and tap-to-select behavior.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1124+168`.


## [1.0.1123] - 2026-09-13

### Fixed

- Fixed the remaining category-bubble coupling seen after `1.0.1122`: a dragged bubble's saved position could be reused as a collision-packing anchor during a later parent rebuild, which caused untouched bubbles to shift around it.
- The automatic collision-free layout is now calculated only from the donut slice geometry. Saved drag positions are applied afterward per bubble, so moving one bubble cannot recalculate, push, pull, or reposition any other bubble.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1123+167`.


## [1.0.1122] - 2026-09-13

- Fixed category-breakdown bubble dragging so each percentage bubble moves completely independently. Dragging one bubble no longer checks, follows, slides around, or reacts to neighboring bubbles.
- Kept the initial automatic collision-free layout from `1.0.1120`, while manual drag movement is now constrained only by the breakdown chart bounds.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1122+166`.


## [1.0.1121] - 2026-09-13

### Changed

- Replaced the dark-mode app/page background gradient with a single neutral near-black `#0F1217` canvas, matching the flatter desktop reference while preserving all existing card, surface, navigation, control, chart, and content styling.
- Applied the same solid dark canvas through the shared theme background so splash, setup, main pages, and routed screens no longer fall back to the previous green gradient.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1121+165`.


## [1.0.1120] - 2026-09-13

### Fixed

- Fixed the category breakdown percentage bubbles initially stacking on top of each other when several small categories occupy nearly the same donut-chart angle. The default badge layout now performs bounded collision packing before painting, preserving the slice-driven placement while separating dense clusters into readable positions.
- Dragged breakdown bubbles can no longer be moved through or dropped on top of another percentage bubble. Drag motion now stops or slides along neighboring badges while remaining constrained inside the breakdown card.
- Preserved custom dragged positions and the existing selected/dragging visual treatment while adding an 8 px collision gap between badge hit areas.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1120+164`.


## [1.0.1119] - 2026-09-13

### Fixed

- Restored automatic Self-Hosted Sync Worker deployment for fork repositories on every push to `main` or `master`, including app-only updates that can change the client/Worker API contract. Canonical repository pushes remain excluded by the existing job guard, while manual deployment remains available.
- Fixed a deployment race where the health check stopped at the first reachable HTTP 200 and could validate Cloudflare's previous Worker version during propagation. It now waits for the complete current capability contract, including `profileMediaSyncAvailable=true`, before passing.
- Improved the final deployment error so a genuinely stale/outdated Worker is distinguished from temporary Cloudflare propagation.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1119+163`.


## [1.0.1118] - 2026-09-13

### Fixed

- Fixed the misleading `Sync pending • Waiting for internet` state. A pending
  outbox no longer claims that the device has no internet; Yutaka now
  distinguishes Worker timeouts, Worker reachability/transport failures, Worker
  errors, and ordinary queued retries.
- Made background sync preserve the real failure message and error code so the
  Account & sync screen and diagnostics can explain why changes are still
  queued instead of hiding silent retry failures.
- Reset the shared HTTP client after Android socket/client/timeout failures so a
  stale pooled connection after Wi-Fi/mobile-network changes cannot keep sync
  stuck while other apps still have internet access.
- Reduced finance upload batches from 100 to 25 operations per Worker request.
  This keeps Turso write transactions smaller and lets large local backlogs
  drain reliably on higher-latency self-hosted deployments while preserving
  idempotent operation IDs.
- Improved Data health backlog findings to show the last sync failure when one
  exists, and made profile-media transfer failures visible instead of reducing
  them to a generic pending state.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1118+162`.


## [1.0.1117] - 2026-09-13

### Fixed

- Restricted Android, Windows, Linux, and macOS release build jobs to the
  canonical `Chowdhury-Siam/Yutaka` repository for both push and manual
  workflow runs, so fork repositories cannot build application release
  packages with the inherited workflow.
- Kept the separate Self-Hosted Sync Worker workflow unchanged so fork owners
  can still deploy their own sync Worker.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1117+161`.


## [1.0.1116] - 2026-09-13

### Changed
- Increased profile-media cloud transfer chunks from 512 KiB to 10 MiB while retaining the existing 50 MB maximum media size.
- Increased the self-hosted Worker encoded-chunk validation limit to match 10 MiB binary chunks after Base64 encoding.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1116+160`.

## [1.0.1115] - 2026-09-13

### Changed
- Removed the empty-profile helper sentence under the profile avatar.
- Removed the file-format/size helper line below the Add media button while keeping the existing media validation and upload limits unchanged.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1115+159`.

## [1.0.1114] - 2026-09-13

### Fixed
- Fixed profile media getting stranded on the device where it was selected: photo/GIF/video uploads, framing changes, and removals now keep cloud retry state pending until the self-hosted sync pass can retry them.
- Opening Profile now forces an immediate account sync so another device checks for the latest profile media instead of waiting for the normal realtime/fallback interval.
- Reduced profile-media transfer chunks from 1 MiB to 512 KiB, keeping 50 MB support while making Worker-to-Turso uploads/downloads more reliable on constrained HTTP/database paths.
- Added explicit `profileMediaSyncAvailable` Worker capability reporting and deployment validation. Old Workers now produce a clear update-required sync error instead of silently leaving Device B on the default avatar.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1114+158`.

### Deployment required
- **Redeploy the latest self-hosted Cloudflare Worker** so profile-media endpoints, tables, realtime notifications, and the new capability check are guaranteed to be present. The standard deployment workflow applies the schema automatically.

## [1.0.1113] - 2026-09-13

### Changed
- Made the Home Net Balance sparkline animation substantially more noticeable with a faster travelling wave, stronger vertical motion, and a synchronized line/fill pulse while preserving reduced-motion behavior.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1113+157`.

## [1.0.1112] - 2026-09-13

- Reworked the Transaction quick menu into a vertical stack with Subscription above Plan.
- Added a staged opening sequence: Plan appears first, then Subscription; closing runs in exact reverse order.
- Preserved the blurred backdrop, menu/close morph, touch targets, desktop hover behavior, and existing navigation actions.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1112+156`.

## [1.0.1111] - 2026-09-13

### Changed
- Category breakdown percentage bubbles can now be dragged freely with mouse or touch while remaining fully constrained inside the breakdown chart surface.
- Dragged bubbles are raised visually during movement and keep their custom position while the breakdown view remains mounted.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1111+155`.


## [1.0.1110] - 2026-09-13

### Changed
- Switched the Flutter app typography to an Apple-style SF Pro Display font stack across the full UI.
- Switched the self-hosted Worker administration website to the same SF Pro Display/SF Pro Text system font stack.
- Preserved platform fallbacks for systems where Apple's SF fonts are not installed.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1110+154`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Integrated `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` into the main eight-value setup checklist and subsequent instructions. The GitHub deployment workflow hashes the administrator password automatically; no separate hash-generation page or command is needed.
- Added the self-hosted Worker's authenticated `/profile` administration portal: account counts, paginated account lists, usernames, creation dates, Active/Invited status, manual account creation, password resets, and confirmed account deletion. The responsive dashboard follows Yutaka's emerald colors, rounded cards, inputs, buttons, light/dark themes, transitions, and reduced-motion preferences.
- Added administrator login using `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` repository secrets, with automatic salted hashing before deployment. Ordinary sync accounts cannot access the portal. The UI displays clear success, invalid-login, duplicate-username, and server/database error messages.
- Added revocable, one-hour administrator sessions with secure HttpOnly cookies, same-origin protection, login throttling, private responses, and a restrictive content security policy. New account passwords use salted PBKDF2 hashes; password resets revoke access/refresh sessions and the previous recovery key. Account deletion removes related cloud records atomically.

### Fixed

- Android Photos and videos permission is no longer requested during startup or onboarding. Yutaka now asks for media access only after the user explicitly taps the profile-photo/media upload action.

### Deployment required

- **Users who already have a self-hosted Cloudflare Worker MUST redeploy their Worker after updating to receive the new `/profile` dashboard and account-management functionality. Updating the app alone is not enough.** Run the latest **Deploy Self-Hosted Sync Worker** workflow, which safely applies the schema migration, and provide all eight setup values documented in the README. Manual deployments must apply the latest schema before redeploying.
- Configuring administrator credentials closes public app registration. Create further accounts in `/profile`; existing accounts continue to use Login. The administrator identity is separate from sync accounts and remains available after deleting the last sync account.


## [1.0.1109] - 2026-09-13

### Fixed

- Fixed desktop hover state layers that could visually extend beyond their pointer hit region or stop short of the rendered control edge. Hover motion now stays entirely inside the control's actual hit bounds instead of scaling past them.
- Standard list tiles, buttons, icon buttons, switches, and custom animated surfaces now use consistent shape-aware hover fills so the hover field covers the complete interactive surface without removing hover feedback.
- Preserved the existing hover animation by animating desktop surfaces from a tiny inset rest scale back to their full 1.0 layout size, preventing edge flicker and hover dead strips.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1109+153`.


## [1.0.1108] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- Fixed desktop text fields sliding horizontally while selecting text with the mouse. The app-wide scroll behavior no longer claims mouse drag gestures that belong to text selection.
- Prevented Yutaka's elastic/always-scrollable page physics from leaking into `EditableText`'s internal caret scrollable, so short field values stay anchored instead of overscrolling or appearing to disappear.
- Kept mouse-wheel and trackpad scrolling for pages/lists while preserving normal mouse selection, copy, cut, paste, and caret behavior in every text field.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1108+152`.

## [1.0.1107] - 2026-09-12

### Added

- Added a centered subscription recurrence picker for Daily, Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly schedules instead of the inline dropdown menu.
- Added an **Auto pay** switch to every subscription. Turning it off keeps the recurring item and its next scheduled date without automatically creating a transaction.
- Expanded **Add now** into a confirmation popup where the user chooses the transaction date, time, and spending account before recording the payment.
- Added database-backed profile media synchronization through the self-hosted Worker. Profile photos, GIFs, and videos now follow the signed-in account to other synced devices, including crop/framing metadata.

### Changed

- Increased the profile photo/video upload limit to **50 MB** and changed local profile-media writes to stream large files instead of loading the full file into memory.
- Profile media uses chunked authenticated Worker uploads and downloads, with realtime sync notifications and retry-safe pending state so finance sync remains available if a large media transfer is interrupted.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1107+151`.

### Deployment required

- **Self-hosted sync users must redeploy the latest Cloudflare Worker** so the new `profile_media` and `profile_media_chunks` database tables and media endpoints are available. The deployment workflow applies the schema automatically before redeploying.

## [1.0.1106] - 2026-09-12

### Changed

- Moved the macOS release job from the legacy Intel GitHub runner to the standard Apple Silicon `macos-15` runner while keeping Flutter's universal release mode enabled, so the published app still contains both `arm64` and `x86_64` slices.
- Replaced the macOS `subosito/flutter-action` setup with a pinned Flutter `3.47.4` source checkout cached between runs. This avoids ARM64 SDK archive resolution failures and removes repeated SDK setup work after the first run.
- Added reusable macOS CocoaPods and incremental `build/macos` caches so later release builds can reuse Xcode/Flutter compilation work instead of rebuilding every dependency from scratch.
- Disabled CocoaPods statistics during CI to remove unnecessary network/analytics overhead.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1106+150`.

### Performance

- The macOS job was the release pipeline bottleneck, spending most of its time inside `flutter build macos` on `macos-15-intel`. The release workflow now targets Apple Silicon and keeps incremental build state, substantially reducing repeat-build wall time.

## [1.0.1105] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- Fixed Linux AppImage packaging failure by resizing and validating the Yutaka icon as a real 512×512 PNG before passing it to `linuxdeploy`.
- Fixed ARM64 desktop CI setup failures caused by `subosito/flutter-action` being unable to resolve some stable ARM64 SDK archive entries. Linux ARM64 now bootstraps the pinned Flutter `3.47.4` tag directly from the official Flutter repository.
- Reworked macOS packaging into a single verified universal build produced on `macos-15-intel`, containing both `x86_64` and `arm64` slices. This avoids the ARM64 Flutter SDK archive resolution failure while keeping native Apple Silicon support.

### Changed

- Pinned desktop and release CI to Flutter `3.47.4` for reproducible builds across runners.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1105+149`.

## [1.0.1104] - 2026-09-12

### Added

- Added first-class Linux desktop release builds for both x64 and ARM64. GitHub Actions now publishes a broad-distro AppImage plus a portable `.tar.gz` bundle for each architecture.
- Added macOS release builds for Apple Silicon ARM64 and Intel x64, publishing both DMG installers and zipped `.app` bundles.
- Added optional Developer ID signing and Apple notarization support for macOS GitHub releases.
- Added Linux desktop launcher metadata and Yutaka branding for packaged AppImages.

### Changed

- Stable GitHub Releases now collect Android, Windows, Linux, and macOS artifacts into the same versioned release and update manifest.
- Updated project documentation and platform metadata for Android, Windows, Linux, and macOS distribution.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1104+148`.

## [1.0.1103] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed
- Fixed the subscription scheduler release-build failure caused by passing a captured nullable `DateTime?` to `dateToDb(DateTime)`. The scheduler now snapshots the processed timestamp into an immutable local before serializing it.
- This fixes both Windows and Android builds that previously failed in `subscription_background_service.dart`.

### Changed
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1103+147`.

## [1.0.1102] - 2026-09-12

### Added
- Added a new Subscriptions page for recurring expenses with configurable price, expense category, spending account, date/time, and daily/weekly/monthly/yearly cadence.
- Added manual “Add now” recording for subscriptions without removing the saved subscription.
- Added automatic due-subscription processing in the foreground and through Android WorkManager while the app is closed. Automatic occurrence IDs are deterministic to prevent duplicate cross-device charges.
- Replaced the Transaction Plan FAB with a three-line quick-action menu that expands into Plan and Subscription actions over a blurred animated backdrop.

### Changed
- Subscription data is included in local/cloud merge sync, category remapping, backups, and the self-hosted Worker Telegram backup payload.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1102+146`.

## [1.0.1101] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- Restored standard text selection and adaptive copy/cut/paste/select-all context menus for every text field on desktop and mobile.
- Read-only/signed-in fields remain selectable and copyable instead of becoming disabled, including Account & sync username and temporarily locked sync setup fields.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1101+145`.

## [1.0.1100] - 2026-09-12

### Changed
- Refined the shared switch theme so on/off toggles no longer render with a harsh outline around the track.
- Improved inactive thumb/track contrast and kept pressed feedback subtle while preserving the existing Yutaka green active state.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1100+144`.

## [1.0.1099] - 2026-09-12

### Changed
- Added an account selector to the loan editor so users can choose which account provides lent money or receives borrowed money.
- Existing loan disbursal records can now move to a different account when the loan is edited, with account balances recalculated correctly.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1099+143`.

## [1.0.1098] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed
- Center popups no longer shrink when the on-screen keyboard opens. Popup sizing now ignores IME insets and stays based on the real safe viewport.
- While typing, popups move toward the top of the screen instead of scaling down, keeping text and controls at their normal readable size.
- The behavior is shared by the transaction editor and every popup using the common Yutaka popup frame.

### Changed
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1098+142`.

## [1.0.1097] - 2026-09-11

### Changed
- Replaced foreground 3-second-style sync polling with authenticated realtime WebSocket change notifications through a Cloudflare Durable Object hub.
- Reduced local sync upload debounce to 120 ms so edits are committed and announced to other open devices almost immediately.
- Uses a 20-second safety pull while realtime is connected, automatically falls back to 3-second polling if the live channel is unavailable, and pulls immediately after a realtime change event.
- Reduced pending-sync retry cadence to 5 seconds and kept conflict/merge handling unchanged.
- Added the `SYNC_HUB` Durable Object binding and deployment migration to the self-hosted Cloudflare Worker.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1097+141`.

## [1.0.1096] - 2026-09-11

### Changed
- Background update checks now run at Android WorkManager's 15-minute periodic floor, so new-release notifications can arrive while Yutaka is closed instead of depending on the next app launch.
- Removed the battery-not-low constraint from the lightweight release check; only an active network connection is required.
- Added a Loan preferences toggle to show or hide loan-linked movements from the main Transaction list without deleting them or changing loan/account data.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1096+140`.

## [1.0.1095] - 2026-09-11

### Changed
- Reduced multi-device sync latency: local edits now queue an upload after a 350 ms debounce instead of 3 seconds.
- Reduced foreground cloud pull cadence from 15 seconds to 3 seconds, with a 2.5-second minimum pull gap.
- Reduced retry cadence for pending sync work from 30 seconds to 10 seconds.
- Reused the sync HTTP client across background push/pull requests to avoid repeated connection and TLS setup.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1095+139`.

## [1.0.1094] - 2026-09-11

### Changed

- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1094+138` so the latest onboarding/profile-media UI build reports the correct new app version.

## [1.0.1093] - 2026-09-11

### Changed

- Removed the desktop-only three-dot transaction overflow menu from transaction cards. Desktop transaction rows now keep the clean amount-only trailing area shown in the mobile design; opening a transaction by clicking the row and the existing swipe/quick-action behavior remain unchanged.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1093+137`.

## [1.0.1092] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed

- Fixed the remaining transaction Slidable snap bug where the **Duplicate** pane revealed by a left-to-right swipe immediately returned to the closed position on release. The leading pane is 28% of the row width, but its previous `.34` open threshold was larger than the pane's maximum extent, making the open state unreachable. The leading-pane thresholds are now sized to that pane (`openThreshold: .14`, `closeThreshold: .08`) so it stays open after a deliberate swipe, matching the right-to-left Edit/Delete behavior.
- No banner, navigation, loan, chart, update-notification, or other UI behavior was changed in this release.

### Changed

- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1092+136`.

## [1.0.1091] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed

- Fixed the top success/error/warning feedback banner visual bug. The oversized Awesome Snackbar MaterialBanner surface is now presented as a compact floating top notification with safe-area spacing, restrained height, balanced icon/text/close alignment, consistent Yutaka rounding, and no decorative shapes bleeding into the message.
- Preserved the same feedback timing, semantic success/error/warning types, and dismiss behavior; no transaction, Slidable, navigation, loan, chart, update-notification, or other UI behavior was changed in this release.

### Changed

- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1091+135`.

## [1.0.1090] - 2026-09-11

### Added

- Added Android background update monitoring when **Automatic update pop-ups** is enabled. Android WorkManager performs a battery-aware network check every few hours and Yutaka posts one deduplicated local notification per newly detected release, including when the app is not currently open. Turning the setting off cancels the worker and its update notification.
- Added a continuously animated Home balance wave using `fl_chart`. The motion is subtle, looped, and automatically stops when Reduce Motion / disabled animations is active.
- Reworked animated empty states so the Lottie pulse remains as ambient motion while the foreground icon now matches the actual section (budget, category spending, transactions, plans, loans, and other empty cards).

### Changed

- Renamed the transaction **Copy** quick action to **Duplicate** and moved it to the leading/left action pane. **Edit** and **Delete** remain on the trailing/right pane. Loan-generated transactions still omit duplication.
- Moved Awesome Snackbar success/error/warning feedback from the bottom SnackBar position to a top MaterialBanner presentation, so messages such as **Done → Transaction deleted** no longer cover the bottom navigation and Add/Plan controls.
- Updated the automatic-update setting description to make its notification behavior explicit.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1090+134`.

## [1.0.1089] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed

- Reworked Slidable quick actions to eliminate the Android partial-swipe artifacts shown in the latest recording. Transaction, planned-purchase, and loan rows now use native `SlidableAction` surfaces with `ScrollMotion`, stable snap thresholds, and clipping to the row radius.
- Removed opposite-side action panes from the same row. All quick actions now live in one trailing pane, preventing cross-direction drags from leaving red/green edge remnants or briefly collapsing an action into a thin strip.
- Disabled drag-dismiss behavior for quick-action panes so an overswipe cannot push a card beyond its intended action extent.
- Kept per-list auto-close behavior so opening one row cleanly closes any previously open row.

### Changed

- Regular transactions reveal **Copy, Edit, Delete** together; loan-generated transactions reveal **Edit, Delete**. Planned purchases reveal **Buy, Edit, Delete**, and active loans reveal **Payment, Edit**.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1089+133`.

## [1.0.1088] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed

- Fixed Flutter Slidable rows rendering as clipped rectangular action strips during partial swipes. Transaction, planned-purchase, and loan quick actions now use rounded Yutaka action surfaces with stable BehindMotion, compact fitted labels, auto-close behavior, and per-list grouping so only one row stays open.
- Fixed the mobile tab transition briefly mixing the previous page with the next tab's dock selection and transaction Plan/Add controls. Page content, dock state, and tab-specific floating actions now transition as one keyed stage.

### Changed

- Removed the **Plan / Monthly installments** controls from the New/Edit loan popup. Existing installment metadata on older loans is preserved when those loans are edited, so the UI cleanup does not erase historical data.
- Removed the per-loan **Account movement** controls from the New/Edit loan popup. New-loan account movement now follows **Loan preferences → Record account movements by default** and automatically uses the default/first regular account when one is available.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1088+132`.

## [1.0.1087] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed

- Fixed `flutter pub get` failing after the Awesome Snackbar Content integration. `awesome_snackbar_content` 0.1.8 uses Flutter localizations, which on the current Flutter 3.47.x toolchain requires `intl ^0.20.3`; Yutaka now uses the same compatible Intl constraint instead of the older `^0.19.0`.
- Kept `awesome_snackbar_content` 0.1.8 rather than downgrading it, preserving the current desktop/mobile fixes and semantic snackbar styling.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1087+131`.

## [1.0.1086] - 2026-09-11

### Added

- Added Lottie-powered empty states for key zero-data screens while respecting the system Reduce Motion setting.
- Added Flutter SpinKit loaders and centralized compact/page loading indicators across the app.
- Added Awesome Snackbar Content for semantic success, warning, and failure feedback while preserving Yutaka's lightweight top notification for ordinary informational messages.
- Added Flutter Slidable actions to transaction, purchase-plan, and loan rows. Touch users can quickly duplicate/edit/delete transactions, buy/edit/delete planned items, and record/edit loans; desktop transaction rows keep an explicit action menu.
- Added a Timelines-based chronological loan history with loan creation, repayments, dates, amounts, and existing repayment deletion controls. The maintained `timelines_plus` implementation is used for current Flutter compatibility.

### Changed

- Expanded `fl_chart` usage by replacing the custom category donut painter with an animated `PieChart`, while keeping category badges, center totals, and the existing green/dark visual system. Existing cash-flow and balance charts remain interactive FL Chart views.
- Added busy-state protection and branded SpinKit feedback to transaction saving, plus success/failure snackbar feedback.
- Raised the declared Dart SDK floor to 3.12 because the current Lottie release requires it; the GitHub Actions Flutter 3.47.x toolchain uses Dart 3.13.x.
- Bumped application metadata to `1.0.1086+130`.

## [1.0.1085] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed

- Restored Android and Windows release compilation after the desktop elastic-scroll update by importing Flutter's gesture library for `PointerSignalEvent` and `PointerScrollEvent`.
- Kept the desktop mouse-wheel edge spring behavior unchanged while making the pointer-signal types available on every Flutter target.
- Synchronized fallback Android version metadata with `1.0.1085+129`.

## [1.0.1084] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed

- Fixed the spring/elastic UI feedback being too subtle or effectively absent with mouse input on the Windows/desktop build. Shared pressable surfaces, Material buttons/FAB wrappers, cards, selectors, and navigation now react directly to mouse pointer down/up and spring back consistently.
- Added a restrained desktop hover lift before the press compression so short mouse clicks still make the elastic interaction visible without changing layout or hit targets; Windows side-rail navigation icons/labels now use the same feedback.
- Enabled restrained elastic top/bottom edge scrolling on desktop while keeping Flutter's native mouse-wheel/trackpad pipeline; no queued `animateTo` wheel handler was reintroduced, so fast PC scrolling remains precise.
- Kept system Reduce Motion / disabled-animation accessibility behavior intact.

## [1.0.1083] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed

- Fixed Android Back / predictive Back dismissing a page or centered popup together with the on-screen keyboard. While the IME is visible, the first Back action now only clears text-field focus and dismisses the keyboard; all entered values and the current form remain intact. A later Back action, after the keyboard is closed, navigates away normally.
- Centralized the behavior in a shared keyboard-back guard used by every standard `PageScaffold`, every centered Yutaka popup, and first-run onboarding currency setup. This covers transaction, account, category, budget, loan, profile, search, login/sync, recovery, currency, and other existing text-entry flows without screen-specific hacks.
- Added the missing tap-outside focus dismissal to all account-recovery text fields so keyboard dismissal behavior is consistent with the rest of the app.

## [1.0.1082] - 2026-09-11

### Changed

- Reworked the app-wide visual system from blue/cyan-tinted dark surfaces to the emerald/forest-green palette shown in the supplied reference video. The update is centralized in shared theme tokens so Home, Analysis, Loans, Transactions, Categories, settings, dialogs, charts, navigation, controls, and future theme-aware components stay consistent.
- Updated dark-mode background/surface layers, glass gradients, navigation highlights, focused controls, progress/switch states, and default theme-facing icon accents to emerald while preserving semantic expense red, warning amber, and category-specific colors.
- Updated the light theme to use a subtle green-neutral surface palette so switching appearance modes keeps the same visual identity.

### Compatibility

- Existing user-selected account/category colors are left untouched. Legacy starter Cash accounts that used the old pale-blue default are still recognized by import/cleanup logic.

## [1.0.1081] - 2026-09-11

### Changed

- Moved **Upload local changes** beside **Restore cloud copy** on the signed-in Account & sync screen, with Recovery key and Sign out kept together on the row below.

### Fixed

- Fixed the Android release workflow overwriting Yutaka's custom splash resources when it regenerated missing Gradle wrapper binaries. Release builds now preserve the complete checked-in Android project and copy back only the generated wrapper files, so Android 12+ uses the dedicated transparent/padded K mark instead of falling back to the rounded-square launcher icon.
- Tightened the Flutter loading mark bounds so the in-app fallback splash also keeps the full K artwork visible without clipping.

## [1.0.1080] - 2026-09-11

### Changed

- Loan-generated entries remain visible in **Transactions**, but opening one now uses a dedicated **Loan** classification instead of presenting it as Expense, Income, or Transfer. The Loan classification is shown only for transactions linked to a loan or loan repayment.
- Loan transaction categories are fixed to **Loan** in the transaction editor so users cannot accidentally reclassify a loan entry as a normal income/expense category.

### Fixed

- Reworked the Android launch artwork to use a transparent, extra-safe padded Yutaka mark instead of the full rounded-square launcher tile, preventing OEM splash-screen masks from cropping the launch logo.
- Editing a linked loan transaction now keeps the underlying loan/repayment record and account balance synchronized. Deleting a linked repayment removes its repayment record safely, while deleting a loan disbursal transaction detaches only the recorded account movement from the loan.

## [1.0.1079] - 2026-09-11

### Added

- Added an **Automatic update pop-ups** toggle on the Updates screen. Turning it off keeps manual update checks available while suppressing automatic update-detail pop-ups.

### Fixed

- Fixed self-hosted sign-in dropping back to the login form immediately after cloud data finished loading. Preference reloads now preserve current self-hosted access/refresh tokens and only run legacy token cleanup when the legacy sync-mode marker actually exists.
- Fixed GitHub release changelog rendering so inline Markdown bold markers such as `**Forgot password?**` display as styled text instead of showing the literal asterisks.
- Fixed the Android launch presentation with a dedicated, correctly padded native splash icon and a launch background that matches the app theme on Android 12+ and older supported Android versions.

## [1.0.1078] - 2026-09-11

### Added

- Added username-based self-hosted authentication and removed email from the login/create-account flow.
- Added recovery-key based **Forgot password?** recovery, including recovery-key rotation for signed-in users.
- Added compatibility migration for existing self-hosted databases and local preferences that still use email-based account identifiers.

### Changed

- Reworked centered popup bodies to stay non-scrollable and scale to the available viewport while keeping intentionally scrollable picker lists contained inside their own fixed-height regions.
- Updated the Turso and Cloudflare setup guide to match the current dashboards shown in the setup recording and the current Cloudflare **Edit Cloudflare Workers** token template.

### Security

- Recovery keys are stored only as keyed hashes, password-recovery attempts are rate limited, successful recovery revokes existing refresh sessions, and recovery responses are marked private/no-store.

## [1.0.1077] - 2026-09-10

- Rewrote the main README as a beginner-friendly user and self-hosted deployment guide suitable for public distribution.
- Simplified the self-hosted GitHub Actions variable/secret names to `CLOUDFLARE_NAME`, `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, `TURSO_DATABASE_URL`, `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN`, and `JWT_SECRET`.
- Updated the deployment workflow, Worker documentation, validation messages, and Wrangler comments to use the same names consistently.


## [1.0.1076] - 2026-09-10

- Added app-wide text-field focus dismissal on outside taps so amount, payment amount, title, notes, profile fields, loan fields, sync fields, and other text inputs release focus when the user moves to another control.
- Simplified Account & sync to one runtime-configured self-hosted Cloudflare Worker, including first-owner registration and Telegram backup access.
- Added migration for existing self-hosted Worker URLs and safely clears obsolete non-self-hosted sync sessions without deleting local finance data.
- Simplified Android/Windows builds and Worker deployment so no sync endpoint is compiled into the app.
- Updated the self-hosted Worker to first-owner registration only and removed the old registration-key deployment path.
- Reworked the main and Worker documentation around the self-hosted-only sync model.

## [1.0.1075] - 2026-09-10

### Changed

- Moved the cash-flow **Net** value into the upper-right of the Cash flow trend header beside the date-range control, keeping the requested value visible without duplicating the metric below.
- Account and category selection sheets now include **Add account** / **Add category** actions. A newly created entry is returned to the originating form and selected immediately.
- Category creation launched from an expense/income picker is locked to the required category type, preventing a newly created incompatible category from being selected accidentally.
- Empty account/category pickers can now open and create their first item instead of failing early.

## [1.0.1074] - 2026-09-10

### Changed

- Transaction date selection now starts in single-date mode. **Use range** explicitly enables Start/End selection, while existing ranged transactions reopen in range mode.
- Reworked the transaction date picker into a bounded, scrollable body with sticky actions so the calendar and controls remain usable on short Android screens.
- Added the same opt-in range workflow to transaction time selection. A transaction can now span a same-day time range or combine a date range with independent start/end times.
- Transaction history labels display a saved time range when the start and end times differ.
- New transactions no longer contain a literal `0` in the Amount field. Zero is now a visual placeholder that disappears as soon as Amount receives focus.
- Opening Category, Account, From account, To account, Date, or Time explicitly dismisses Amount focus and the numeric keyboard first.

### Fixed

- Fixed the transaction date-range dialog being effectively unscrollable when its calendar exceeded the available popup height.
- Same-day time ranges are now persisted through the existing transaction `end_on` field instead of being discarded merely because both endpoints use the same date.

## [1.0.1073] - 2026-09-09

### Changed

- Added restrained spring/elastic micro-interactions across tappable cards, selectors, navigation, and the Transaction Add/Plan actions without redesigning the UI.
- Mobile lists now use a soft elastic edge response while desktop mouse/trackpad scrolling remains clamped and precise.
- Page and bottom-tab changes now combine a short fade with a subtle scale/slide transition instead of hard swaps.
- Low-end-friendly rendering still avoids expensive gradients/shadows, but no longer disables all lightweight UI animation; Android/iOS Reduce Motion remains respected.
- Added light haptic feedback for main tab changes and Transaction Add/Plan actions.

## [1.0.1072] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed
- Fixed self-hosted Telegram backups that could decrypt successfully but contain zero finance rows. The Worker now refuses to send an empty `.yutakabackup` and returns a clear recovery message instead of producing a file that later appears to restore successfully.
- Telegram backup generation now reconstructs current cloud state from sync history when `sync_entities` is unexpectedly empty but recoverable `sync_changes` still exist.
- Backup restore now validates the actual supported finance-row count rather than treating a database object containing only empty arrays as valid data.
- **Upload local changes** now reconciles the complete local snapshot, so records that existed before signing in to a self-hosted Worker are uploaded instead of being missed because they were never in the sync outbox.
- **Upload backup now** and enabling automatic Telegram backup first force a full local/cloud reconciliation, ensuring the Worker packages the latest complete device data.
- Forced reconciliation now completes rebased conflict operations in the same action instead of waiting for a later background retry.
- A stale local entity version from another backend now rebases to server version `0` when the new Worker has no matching entity, allowing the local row to be inserted instead of silently disappearing from cloud backups.
- Signing out resets account-specific sync versions, cursor, conflicts, and outbox tracking without deleting finance data, preventing state from the Default Worker from contaminating a Self-hosted Worker (or another account).
- Existing-account login now pulls/merges the cloud first and then adopts the complete merged local snapshot back to that account, so local-only records become part of future Worker backups automatically.

### Changed
- Telegram-generated backups include per-table `record_counts` and a total `finance_record_count` diagnostic field while remaining compatible with the existing `.yutakabackup` restore format.

## [1.0.1071] - 2026-09-09

### Added
- Optional Telegram `.yutakabackup` delivery for the **self-hosted Sync Worker**. A bot button now appears in the Account & sync app bar only while Self-hosted is selected and the device is signed in.
- Self-hosted owners can configure a Telegram bot token, group/channel Chat ID, daily/weekly/monthly schedule, exact local time, weekly day or monthly date, test delivery, and **Upload backup now** from Yutaka.
- The self-hosted Worker encrypts the saved bot token with an AES-GCM key derived from its `JWT_SECRET`, stores only the encrypted token in Turso, creates a cloud-state `.yutakabackup`, and uploads it directly to Telegram.
- A dedicated self-hosted Wrangler config adds a five-minute Cron Trigger. The managed/default owner Worker does not receive this trigger and the Telegram-backup API rejects managed invite-key deployments.

### Changed
- Self-hosted deployment applies the Telegram backup settings table automatically; no extra GitHub/Cloudflare secret is required for the user's backup bot because its token is configured from the authenticated app screen.

## [1.0.1070] - 2026-09-09

### Added
- The **Plan** page now shows the combined price of every planned item in the top-right header area.
- Existing profile media can now be repositioned and zoom-cropped non-destructively, with framing saved locally and reused for the profile avatar and previews.

### Changed
- Removed the **Savings Suggestion** feature, its profile/preferences UI, suggestion bubbles, recommendation model, and active preference payloads.
- Removed **Bio** from Profile information; profile information now contains the display name and sync-account details only.
- Cloud sync now automatically closes conflict records after the merged/rebased entity has no pending outbox operation. Data health also clears legacy stale conflicts that predate the last successful sync, so already-resolved conflicts do not remain permanently open.
- Repeated server conflicts for the same entity update the existing open conflict record instead of creating duplicate open diagnostics.

### Migration
- Legacy Savings Suggestion and profile Bio preference keys are purged during preference loading so older local/cloud payloads cannot revive removed UI or behavior.

## [1.0.1069] - 2026-09-09

### Added
- Added a **Plan** floating action button on the Transaction tab for purchase planning.
- Added a dedicated Plan page where users can create and edit items with an expected price and expense category.
- Planned items can be purchased directly: Yutaka opens a centered account chooser, creates an expense transaction with the current date/time, deducts the selected account, and removes the completed planned item.
- Planned purchases are included in local backups, merge restores, category deduplication, and multi-device sync.

### Changed
- Planned purchase records participate in the same non-destructive merge and conflict-resolution pipeline as the rest of the finance database.
- Category deduplication now remaps planned-item category references as well as transaction and budget references.

## [1.0.1068] - 2026-09-09

### Changed
- Starter Cash/Card/Bank Account placeholders are now created only after the user explicitly chooses **Start new**. Fresh **Login** and **Restore backup** flows no longer begin with preloaded accounts.
- Backup restore and cloud-login import paths remove only untouched built-in starter-account fingerprints before merging, preventing duplicate placeholder Cash/Card/Bank Account rows while preserving used or customized accounts.
- Automatic-backup retention no longer uses a numeric **How many to keep** slider. The new **Delete older automatic backups** switch defaults on; when enabled, only the newest automatic backup is kept, and when disabled, automatic backup history is retained.
- Automatic local backup now requires an explicit folder. The **App storage** destination option has been removed.
- Choosing an automatic-backup location creates and uses a dedicated `Yutaka/Backup` subfolder. Android keeps the parent folder grant through Storage Access Framework so scheduled backups continue after restarts.
- Removed **Restore last safety backup** from Advanced settings. Safety backups remain internal protection for risky data operations.

### Fixed
- Restoring a backup during first-run offline setup no longer leaves Yutaka's preloaded starter accounts beside the restored accounts.
- Existing-account login now discards untouched preloaded starter placeholders before and after the cloud merge, and pushes tombstones so old cloud placeholders cannot return.
- Upgrading an existing installation that already has the old duplicate-starter bug now detects a redundant untouched starter fingerprint and cleans the remaining built-in placeholders while preserving used or customized accounts.

## [1.0.1067] - 2026-09-09

### Added
- Android automatic backup folders now use the system Storage Access Framework and retain a persistent write grant, allowing scheduled backups to save to user-selected internal or SD-card folders after app restarts.
- Added a shared non-destructive finance merge engine for local backups, cloud restores, legacy snapshot sync, and conflict recovery.
- Added merge regression tests covering local-only/cloud-only rows, same-ID reconciliation, category deduplication, preference remapping, and Android folder-access contracts.

### Changed
- **Upload local changes** is now merge-first: cloud-only records are preserved and newer same-ID records are reconciled instead of replacing the cloud dataset.
- **Restore cloud copy** now performs a two-way merge. Local-only records remain on the device, the full cloud history is folded in, and any resulting local changes are queued back to cloud.
- Loading a `.yutakabackup` or restoring the last safety backup now merges with the active local database rather than replacing it.
- Categories are deduplicated semantically by category type plus normalized, case-insensitive name. For example, local `Food` and cloud ` food ` resolve to one category and transaction/budget/preference references are remapped to it.
- Same-ID entity conflicts use `updated_on` (falling back to `created_on`) to retain the newer row; unrelated IDs are unioned.
- The older Sync ID/PIN snapshot screen now follows the same merge semantics for both upload and download.

### Fixed
- Fixed Android `PathAccessException: Operation not permitted` when automatic backup targeted raw `/storage/...` paths under scoped storage.
- Older raw-path automatic-backup settings are detected and ask the user to choose the folder once through Android's system picker instead of repeatedly attempting an unwritable filesystem path.
- Upload conflicts are rebased even when the subsequent pull contains no additional rows, preventing a newer local edit from disappearing at a cursor boundary.
- Removed the Flutter client's destructive replace-all path from restored-data synchronization; legacy pending restore flags are migrated into normal merge upserts.

## [1.0.1066] - 2026-09-09

### Added
- First-run **Use offline** now opens a **Restore backup / Start new** choice instead of immediately entering the new-profile setup flow.
- Creating a sync account during onboarding now opens the same setup choice automatically. Restoring a backup makes the restored local dataset authoritative for the newly created sync account.
- If the setup chooser is dismissed after account creation, onboarding shows **Continue setup** so the user can return to the Restore/Start New decision without creating another account.

### Changed
- Restoring a backup during first-run setup completes onboarding immediately because the backup already contains the user's finance data and preferences. **Start new** continues through Currency and Accounts as before.
- The first-run restore option clearly warns that the current local finance data on the device will be replaced.
- New sync-account registration during onboarding now waits for the Restore/Start New decision before seeding cloud data, so temporary starter data is not uploaded when the user intends to restore a backup.

### Fixed
- Switching from **Create account** to **Login** inside onboarding now restores the existing cloud copy and completes setup instead of returning to first-run local setup.

## [1.0.1065] - 2026-09-09

### Added
- Loan start dates, due dates, and repayment records now include an editable time as well as a date. Existing loan records remain compatible and continue to load normally.
- Added **Advanced settings > Automatic local backup** with daily, weekly, or monthly scheduling, a selectable backup time, configurable retention count, and a selectable local backup folder.
- Automatic backups use separate `yutaka_auto_*.yutakabackup` files, prune only older automatic backups, and never delete manual or safety backups.
- Missed scheduled backups are created when Yutaka next opens or resumes, and the settings screen shows the last/next automatic backup state.

### Changed
- Loan detail and payment history now display the recorded time alongside the date.

## [1.0.1064] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed
- Removed the Android CI temporary signing-key fallback. Release APK builds now require the permanent Yutaka signing secrets and fail immediately if any signing secret is missing.
- Added validation for the decoded release keystore, configured alias, and store password before Flutter starts the Android release build.
- The workflow now prints the configured release certificate SHA-256 fingerprint in the build log so the signing identity can be checked between releases.

### Changed
- Android release signing now uses only the permanent `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`, `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`, and `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD` repository secrets.

## [1.0.1063] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed
- Restored `android/app/google-services.json` to the source tree so Android Firebase configuration is available directly during local and GitHub Actions builds.
- Removed the `GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON_BASE64` GitHub secret requirement and its CI decode step.
- Stopped ignoring `android/app/google-services.json` in `.gitignore`.

## [1.0.1062] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed
- Rebuilt the shared Choose picker layout so the active option is rendered only once; removed the duplicate selected-value preview row below the picker.
- Choose Date Filter, Theme, Account, Category, and other shared selectors now shrink to the number of available options instead of leaving a large empty wheel viewport on desktop.
- Replaced the fragile fixed-center wheel presentation in shared selectors with a compact native-scrolling list that keeps the selected row highlighted and preserves smooth mouse-wheel, touchpad, and touch scrolling.
- Currency selection now uses the same compact selectable-list behavior, with search retained and no duplicate selected-value summary.

### Changed
- Long Choose lists show up to four rows at once with a desktop scrollbar; short lists stay compact while Cancel and Done remain fixed below the options.

## [1.0.1061] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed
- Removed the custom desktop pointer-wheel animation layer that queued `animateTo` calls and caused jerky, overshooting, or jumping scroll behavior. Desktop pages, mouse wheels, touchpads, and fixed-item Choose pickers now use Flutter's native scrolling pipeline.
- Removed selection-size changes from wheel rows so Theme, Currency, account/category selectors, and other Choose pickers no longer resize items while they are moving.
- Windows updates now download inside Yutaka instead of opening the GitHub installer URL directly. The Windows updater now shows the same live percentage, transferred size, speed, animated progress panel, cancel state, and retry behavior used by Android.
- Downloaded Windows installers are retained as pending updates and can be launched again if installation is not completed on the first attempt.

### Changed
- Windows update downloads now verify that the installer comes from the configured Yutaka GitHub release before saving or launching it.

## [1.0.1060] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed
- First-run account creation now offers Savings alongside Regular and Credit, so a savings account can be created directly during onboarding.
- Choice-wheel scrolling now uses a dedicated fixed-item desktop animator instead of the generic page-scroll handler; Theme, Currency, and other wheel selectors move and snap cleanly without visible jumps.
- Profile media no longer shows technical file metadata or the supported-format/size helper after media has been added.

### Changed
- Improved selection motion in wheel-based pickers with consistent scale/opacity transitions across the app.

## [1.0.1059] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed
- Download progress wave now continuously animates while an update is downloading instead of becoming static when reduced-motion settings are enabled.
- Choose Color no longer uses a nested non-scrollable grid that could swallow desktop mouse-wheel input; preset colors now use a wrap layout so the page scrolls normally.
- Transaction date-range selection now opens in Yutaka's centered popup instead of taking over the entire screen.

### Changed
- Transaction Title now appears above Amount for Expense and Income entry.
- Removed the “Tap or drag for exact values” helper text from Cash flow trend.

## [1.0.1058] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- Reworked the appearance-color screens for Windows/large displays so the preset palette uses compact fixed-density rows instead of oversized empty grid cells.
- Rebuilt the custom color picker with a desktop two-column layout and a capped color wheel, preventing the wheel and controls from stretching far beyond usable desktop sizes.
- Constrained the photo color picker on desktop so the complete appearance-color workflow remains readable at wide window sizes.
- Made the generated Windows runner title patch handle both Flutter runner templates so the title bar consistently shows `Yutaka` instead of the lowercase generated project name.

### Changed

- Reduced CI release work by building only the requested ARM32, ARM64, and Universal Android APKs; removed the unnecessary x86_64 APK and AAB release artifacts.
- Added reusable Dart package caching, cached Windows extracted native dependencies, skipped already-installed Android SDK/NDK packages, and avoided reinstalling Inno Setup when it is already present.
- Universal Android APKs are now produced directly by Flutter instead of building an AAB and running bundletool, reducing release-job overhead.

## [1.0.1057] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- New sync-account registration during first-run setup now always continues through Currency and Accounts instead of accidentally completing onboarding when registration was selected from the Login screen.
- The Accounts setup step now makes add, edit, and remove actions explicit.

### Changed

- Replaced the previous Analysis Trend card with a cleaner cash-flow trend that includes Income/Expense/Net summaries, Both/Income/Expense views, clearer date labels, touch values, and an improved empty state.
- Increased the profile photo/GIF/video limit from 500 KB to 1000 KB across validation, UI guidance, and tests.

## [1.0.1056] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed

- Update checks now read a public release manifest before using the GitHub API,
  avoiding GitHub API rate-limit failures for normal in-app update checks.

## [1.0.1055] - 2026-09-01

### Changed

- Removed the Advanced settings performance toggle.
- Made low-end-friendly UI rendering the default by reducing heavy motion,
  press animations, gradients, and shadows automatically.

## [1.0.1054] - 2026-08-31

### Changed

- Reworked mobile scrolling to use smoother Android-style clamping with tuned
  fling momentum instead of the previous iOS-like bouncing behavior.
- Added smoother desktop mouse-wheel/trackpad scrolling through the shared app
  scroll behavior.

## [1.0.1053] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed

- Made the update prompt appear automatically after startup and retry on app
  resume when the first background check hits a temporary GitHub/network issue.
- Aligned the native Android version name/code with the Flutter release version.

## [1.0.1052] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed

- Transaction history now filters and sorts ranged transactions by their end
  date, so an Aug 25 to Aug 31 transaction appears with Aug 31 records.

## [1.0.1051] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed

- Raised the full cloud replacement upload limit to 25000 operations with a
  dedicated `MAX_SYNC_REPLACE_SIZE` Worker setting.

## [1.0.1050] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed

- Added a targeted owner Worker deployment hint when Cloudflare returns `1042`
  during the health check because a Worker route or backend URL is looping.

## [1.0.1049] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed

- Made Worker deployment health checks wait through fresh workers.dev TLS and
  route propagation instead of failing immediately on transient curl TLS exits.

## [1.0.1048] - 2026-08-31

### Changed

- Removed the committed Firebase Android config and restored it during Android
  CI builds from the `GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON_BASE64` GitHub secret.

## [1.0.1047] - 2026-08-30

### Changed

- Pointed GitHub update checks, release workflow gates, documentation links,
  and the in-app GitHub link at `Chowdhury-Siam/Yutaka`.

## [1.0.1046] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- Added a Profile entry to the Categories header with editable display name and
  bio fields.
- Added profile photo, animated GIF, and short-video selection, preview,
  replacement, removal, and muted looping playback on Android and Windows.
- Enforced a 500 KB profile-media limit before private app storage and added
  clear validation feedback for oversized or unsupported files.
- Added a first-launch Android Photos and videos permission flow with retry and
  app-settings recovery for denied and permanently denied states.

### Changed

- Moved Savings Suggestion preferences from Settings into the Profile screen so
  they have one configuration location.
- Removed the date-range pill from the Categories breakdown header while
  retaining the active app-wide date range for calculations and chart context.

## [1.0.1045] - 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- Prevented categories with different IDs but the same normalized name and type
  from multiplying after backup restore, upload, or multi-device sync.
- Existing duplicates are merged deterministically while transaction, budget,
  filter, and default-category references are moved to the retained category.
- New categories and loan-generated categories now reject or reuse equivalent
  names instead of creating another record.

## [1.0.1044] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- Added an optional start-to-end date range to income, expense, and transfer
  transactions while applying each transaction amount only once.
- Transaction history now displays the saved date span, and older single-date
  transactions remain compatible.

### Changed

- Advanced the local database, backup, and full-sync payload versions for the
  optional transaction end date.

## [1.0.1043] - 2026-08-28

### Changed

- Simplified the main Settings screen and centralized backup and restore tools
  in Advanced settings.

## [1.0.1042] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- Added a required Title field when creating or editing an income or expense
  transaction.
- Transaction titles now appear as the primary label throughout transaction,
  category, and budget history.

### Changed

- Existing income and expense records receive their category name as a safe
  title during the database upgrade.
- Backup and full-sync payload versions were advanced for the new transaction
  field.

## [1.0.1041] - 2026-08-28

### Changed

- Moved Loans from the Home dashboard into the center of the primary bottom
  navigation, between Analysis and Transactions.
- Added the same Loans destination to the Windows navigation rail and removed
  the duplicate Loans card from Home.

## [1.0.1040] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- Added a complete lending and borrowing tracker with contacts, due dates,
  notes, repayment history, statuses, and Home summary totals.
- Added no-interest, simple-interest, flat-interest, and compound-interest
  calculations using a consistent annual percentage rate, with optional
  installment estimates and interest-first repayment allocation.
- Added optional account-linked disbursal and repayment movements, due-date
  reminders, backup and sync coverage, and loan-specific data-health checks.
- Added focused tests for repayment calculations, due-date behavior, APR
  semantics, and report exclusions.

### Changed

- Loan-linked account movements update account balances but are excluded from
  income, expense, budget, and cash-flow reporting.

## [1.0.1039] - 2026-08-28

### Changed

- Removed the extra overview badge from the Home balance summary and tightened
  the surrounding layout.

## [1.0.1038] - 2026-08-28

### Changed

- Removed obsolete compatibility paths and unused media from the source
  package.
- Updated project documentation to match the current feature set.

## [1.0.1037] - 2026-08-28

### Changed

- Worker changes in `Chowdhury-Siam/Yutaka` now automatically deploy the
  Owner/Default sync Worker, while the owner deployment job is always skipped
  in forks.
- Worker changes in fork repositories now automatically deploy the User
  Self-hosted sync Worker, while automatic original-repository pushes skip the
  self-hosted deployment job.
- Manual self-hosted deployment remains available in any repository; manual
  owner deployment remains restricted to the original repository.

## [1.0.1036] - 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- Stable update checks now use GitHub's designated Latest release, preventing
  the older `1.0.1035` tag from replacing newer releases such as `1.0.77` in
  the update dialog.
- Prerelease checks preserve GitHub's release-feed order instead of sorting
  historical tags by their numeric semantic version.

### Changed

- Restored monotonically increasing release versioning at `1.0.1036` so apps
  using the previous updater can discover and install this correction.

## [1.0.78] - 2026-08-28

### Changed

- Android APK/AAB and Windows installer jobs now run automatically only in the
  original `Chowdhury-Siam/Yutaka` repository. Fork owners can still start
  artifact builds manually.
- Stable GitHub Release publishing is restricted to the original repository,
  including manually dispatched builds.

## [1.0.77] - 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- Self-hosted account creation now removes the Registration Key field as soon
  as Self-hosted is selected and never includes a registration key in the
  request payload.
- Self-hosted endpoints must report first-owner registration mode before the
  app accepts them, and authentication stays disabled until the selected
  endpoint is validated.

## [1.0.76] - 2026-08-28

### Changed

- Separated the user self-hosted deployment configuration from the legacy owner deployment configuration.

## [1.0.75] - 2026-08-27

### Changed

- Separated self-hosted GitHub deployment configuration from the legacy owner deployment configuration.

## [1.0.74] - 2026-08-27

### Changed

- Split Worker deployment into a fork-friendly self-hosted workflow and a
  manual owner/default-service workflow with separate owner-prefixed secrets.
- Owner deployment now verifies invite-key mode and bootstraps Telegram
  registration-key delivery without affecting user self-hosted deployments.

## [1.0.73] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- Worker deployment now health-checks the exact public target reported by
  Wrangler instead of reconstructing the `workers.dev` URL.
- Deployment rejects non-Turso database URLs and reports Cloudflare error pages
  without producing a misleading `jq` parse error.

## [1.0.72] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- Added optional self-hosted cloud sync using a user-owned Cloudflare Worker
  and Turso database, with runtime endpoint selection and health validation.

### Changed

- Self-hosted deployment now requires only Cloudflare, Turso, and JWT
  configuration; Telegram and registration-administrator secrets are not
  required.
- Fork builds can use temporary Android signing when permanent signing secrets
  are absent, and the default sync endpoint is optional.
- Rewrote the project README with complete setup, deployment, security, build,
  and troubleshooting documentation.

### Fixed

- Self-hosted account creation no longer asks for a managed-service
  registration key and safely closes registration after the first owner.
- Release builds and tags now use the version declared in `pubspec.yaml`.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Added server-enforced, invite-key-based account registration with one active single-use key, atomic consumption/rotation, expiration, revocation, and an auditable Turso key ledger.
- Added automatic Telegram delivery for each newly rotated registration key, delivery retry tracking, and protected administrator status/reveal/rotate/revoke/retry endpoints.

### Fixed

- Hardened account sync with transactional compare-and-set writes so concurrent devices cannot both accept the same entity base version.
- Idempotent sync retries now return the version assigned by the original accepted operation instead of the stale client base version.
- Budget scope edits and budget deletion now enqueue cloud tombstones for removed account/category mappings.
- Removed runtime schema mutation from normal Cloudflare Worker requests; schema deployment remains an explicit deployment step.

- Account signup now rejects missing, invalid, expired, revoked, and previously used registration keys with clear user-facing messages.
- Latest release changelog now publishes only the current update notes instead of the full accumulated development history.

### Changed

- Android release signing now requires injected keystore secrets; the release keystore and passwords are no longer stored in source.
- Removed the obsolete device-lock module from the application UI, models,
  notifications, and dependencies.

- The default-service Create account form now requires a Registration Key and
  relies on backend validation; self-hosted registration uses the first-owner
  flow without a key.
- Added a Pursenal-style Load backup workflow in Settings that opens a file picker, loads a `.yutakabackup` file, replaces local data, and triggers the existing cloud-upload path when signed in.
- Android package/application ID changed from `com.siamapps.yutaka` to `com.yutaka.siam`.
- Transaction amount entry now uses the normal phone/desktop keyboard instead of Yutaka's old custom on-screen keypad.
- Release automation now falls back to only the first/current bullet under each Unreleased heading, so accidental older notes do not flood the newest GitHub Release body.

### Previous development history

- Long scrolling lists now avoid duplicate row repaint boundaries, unnecessary keep-alive bookkeeping, and semantic index calculations that made Windows scrolling feel choppier.
- Desktop card surfaces now avoid animated container work, heavy shadows, and per-card gradients during normal rendering for smoother Windows scrolling.
- Desktop list preloading was reduced so fast scrolling builds fewer off-screen finance cards at once.
- Login/cloud restore now removes untouched starter Cash/Card/Bank Account placeholders from the restored local copy, even when real cloud data also exists.
- Other signed-in devices now automatically pull cloud changes while the app is open and whenever the app resumes, so new transactions appear across devices without manual restore.
- Android no longer reopens the package installer for a downloaded update after that same version is already installed.
- Made Account & sync uploads more reliable by giving full restore uploads a longer request timeout and replacing raw timeout exceptions with clean user-facing messages.
- Prevented Upload restored/local changes from appearing to do nothing while a background sync retry is already running.
- Login from setup or Account & sync now always treats cloud data as the source of truth and fully replaces local finance data on the device.
- Release notes are grouped by current changes, additions, removals, and fixes so the in-app updater shows only the useful “what changed in this update” text.
- Renamed the Account & sync upload button to “Upload restored data” whenever a restored local backup still needs to become the cloud source of truth.
- Hid the Account & sync backend-configuration explanation card and the restore/upload help paragraph to keep the sync page cleaner.
- Reduced Cloudflare Worker subrequests during `/v1/sync/replace` by batching snapshot entity/change writes instead of calling Turso several times per entity.
- Removed per-operation sequence lookups from authoritative cloud replace uploads; the app only needs accepted entity versions plus the final server cursor for this flow.
- Hardened the Cloudflare Worker `/v1/sync/replace` endpoint so duplicate snapshot upserts are coalesced by entity before writing to Turso.
- Made replace-sync processed operation writes idempotent, preventing repeated operation IDs from turning cloud overwrite attempts into 500 responses.
- Added sanitized Worker-side logging for unexpected internal errors so future Cloudflare logs show the useful failure reason.
- Fixed Android release builds on newer Flutter SDKs by hiding Flutter's `Category` and `Summary` annotation exports where they collided with Yutaka finance models.
- Fixed clean ZIP packaging on Windows so entries use GitHub-compatible `/` paths instead of literal backslash filenames.
- Ensured workflow files package as `.github/workflows/*.yml`, allowing GitHub Actions to detect them after upload.
- Continued Phase 13 source-structure cleanup by extracting shared icon lookup/rendering helpers into `lib/icon_helpers.dart`.
- Reduced `lib/main.dart` further by moving reusable icon glyph and icon bubble UI helpers out of the main app file.
- Continued Phase 12 source-structure cleanup by extracting reusable Yutaka branding widgets into `lib/branding_widgets.dart`.
- Moved the shared `firstOrNull` collection extension into `lib/collection_utils.dart`.
- Continued Phase 11 source-structure cleanup by extracting `ReminderService` into `lib/reminder_service.dart`.
- Moved legacy Cloudflare sync, account sync API, and MongoDB snapshot sync helpers into `lib/sync_services.dart`.
- Removed notification/timezone/MongoDB implementation details from `lib/main.dart`, leaving the app controller/UI to consume service APIs.
- Continued Phase 10 source-structure cleanup by extracting preference/secure credential stores into `lib/persistence_stores.dart`.
- Moved shared sync error/session data types into `lib/sync_models.dart` so future sync-service extraction can happen without touching UI code.
- Continued Phase 9 source-structure cleanup by extracting shared UI foundation primitives into `lib/ui_foundation.dart`.
- Moved responsive breakpoints, motion constants, shape helpers, page transitions, pressable wrapper behavior, and optimized scroll behavior out of `lib/main.dart`.
- Started Phase 8 source-structure cleanup by extracting app configuration/constants into `lib/app_config.dart` and finance data models/helpers into `lib/models.dart`.
- Reduced the size of `lib/main.dart` and began separating the app into clearer layers so future analyzer/editor performance work can continue safely.
- Added Phase 7 validation reliability: the local validation helper now supports explicit timeouts for `flutter pub get`, `flutter analyze --fatal-infos`, and `flutter test`, plus skip flags for each stage.
- Validation now reports likely analyzer timeout causes clearly instead of hanging silently when the current large single-file Flutter app overwhelms analysis.
- Added Phase 6 validation and packaging cleanup so generated packages no longer include worker `node_modules`, Flutter build folders, local output folders, or transient logs.
- Added reusable `tool/package_project.ps1` and `tool/validate_project.ps1` helpers for clean ZIP creation and repeatable local validation.
- Added repository ignore/exclude rules for Worker dependency/cache folders and generated packaging outputs to keep analysis and release archives focused on source files.
- Added Phase 5 privacy-safe diagnostics reports that can be copied or shared from Data health.
- Diagnostics now summarize app version, platform, setup state, local data counts, sync status, pending uploads, conflicts, update state, and health findings without exposing tokens or backend secrets.
- Added Phase 4 diagnostics with Advanced settings → Data health for local data, sync backlog, sync conflicts, and skipped setup leftovers.
- Added a safe Data health cleanup action for untouched starter accounts that remain after the user skipped account setup.
- Added Phase 3 data safety: automatic local safety backups are created before manual restores, legacy cloud restores, full cloud-overwrite syncs, and server reset sync operations.
- Yutaka now keeps the newest 3 safety backups and exposes Restore last safety backup in Advanced settings.
- Login/cloud-restore no longer clears local data before a successful cloud download; the app downloads first, saves a safety backup, then overwrites local finance data.
- Started Phase 2 polish by reducing desktop transitions, card animations, update-wave animation, gradients, and heavy shadows.
- Made desktop page headers more compact for a less oversized Windows layout.
- Started Phase 1 polish with clearer sync stages, explicit Restore cloud copy vs Upload local changes actions, and a Home empty-state recovery card for no-account/offline setups.
- Setup Login now signs in, cloud-overwrites local setup/default data, completes setup, and opens the app immediately.
- Persisted the Accounts setup Skip choice and added a safe cleanup for old installs where the untouched Cash/Card/Bank Account starter placeholders remained visible after skipping.
- Fixed setup-page Create account so it returns to setup instead of completing onboarding early and bouncing back later.
- Restore now automatically schedules an authoritative cloud upload when signed in, so restored data becomes the cloud source of truth.
- Added account-sync replace support so other devices fully clear local finance data before applying a restored cloud copy.
- Removed the Home Quick actions block for a cleaner dashboard.
- Fixed the onboarding account setup Skip action so untouched starter accounts are removed instead of staying in the app.
- Reduced route/tab motion and expensive background glow layers for smoother Android and Windows performance.
- Optimized Android release CI by generating the Universal APK from the AAB instead of running a duplicate universal APK build.
- Added a GitHub Releases-based in-app updater.
- Added Settings → Updates with installed version, latest release, update status, release date, and GitHub release changelog.
- Added Android APK architecture selection for ARM64, ARM32, x86_64, and Universal builds.
- Added in-app Android APK downloading with live progress, speed, downloaded size, and animated wave progress.
- Added Android installer handoff with FileProvider content URI support and install-from-this-source permission handling.
- Added Windows update handling that prefers installer assets before falling back to the GitHub release page.
- Updated release automation to publish semantic-version assets and use changelog text for release notes.
